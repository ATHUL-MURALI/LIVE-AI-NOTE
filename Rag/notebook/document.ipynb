    "    \"../data/text_files/machine_learning.txt\" : \"\"\"Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on building algorithms capable of learning patterns from data and making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each task. Instead of following hard-coded rules, ML models improve their performance through experience—adapting as they process more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, ML involves training a model on historical data so it can generalize to unseen data. This generalization is the ultimate goal, enabling applications like fraud detection, recommendation systems, speech recognition, and autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning – Uses labeled datasets to map inputs to known outputs. Common for classification (e.g., spam detection) and regression (e.g., price prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised Learning – Works with unlabeled data to find hidden patterns, clusters, or associations (e.g., customer segmentation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-Supervised Learning – Combines a small amount of labeled data with large amounts of unlabeled data to improve learning efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning – Trains an agent to make sequential decisions by rewarding desirable actions and penalizing undesirable ones (e.g., robotics, game AI).\n",
    "\n",
    "How ML Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation: Collect, clean, and preprocess data (feature engineering, normalization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Selection: Choose an algorithm (e.g., decision trees, neural networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Training: Adjust model parameters to minimize error (loss function optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation: Test on unseen data to measure accuracy and avoid overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deployment: Integrate into real-world systems for inference.\n",
    "\n",
