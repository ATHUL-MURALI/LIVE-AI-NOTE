The overhead for the translation is incurred just once, when the source\\nis compiled; thereafter, it need only be loaded and executed.\\nDuring the design of an application, you might need to decide whether to use a\\ncompiled language or an interpreted language for the application source code.\\nInterpreted languages, in contrast, must be parsed, interpreted, and executed\\neach time the program is run\\nThus, an interpreted language is generally more suited for doing ”ad hoc” cal-\\nculations or simulations, while compiled languages are better for permanent\\napplications where speed is in focus.\\n2.2\\nPython Packages\\nWith Python you don’t get so much out of the box. Instead of having all of\\nits functionality built into its core, you need to install diﬀerent packages for\\ndiﬀerent topics.\\nThis approach has advantages and disadvantages. An disadvantage is that you\\nneed to install these packages separately and then later import these modules\\nin your code.\\nThis is also typical approach for open source software, because everybody can\\ncreate their own Python packages and distribute them. In that way you also\\nﬁnd Python packages for almost everything, from Scientiﬁc Computing to Web\\nDevelopment.\\n19'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.18', 'creator': 'TeX', 'creationdate': '2020-08-12T08:23:16+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Python Programming.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Python Programming.pdf', 'total_pages': 140, 'format': 'PDF 1.5', 'title': '', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2020-08-12T08:23:16+00:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': 'D:20200812082316Z', 'creationDate': 'D:20200812082316Z', 'page': 22}, page_content='These packages need to be downloaded and installed separately, or you choose\\nto use, e.g., a distribution package like Anaconda, where you typically get the\\npackages you need for scientiﬁc computing.

to communicate with each other, we use a \\nprogramming language like Python to communicate with the computer. \\nProgramming is a way to instruct the computer to perform various tasks. \\nWHAT IS PYTHON? \\nPython is a simple and easy to understand language which feels like reading simple \\nEnglish. This Pseudo code nature is easy to learn and understandable by beginners. \\nFEATURES OF PYTHON \\n• Easy to understand = Less development time  \\n• Free and open source \\n• High level language \\n• Portable: Works on Linux / Windows / Mac. \\n• Fun to work with! \\nINSTALLATION \\nPython can be easily installed from python.org.

Create a file called hello.py and paste the \\nbelow code in it. \\nprint(\"hello world\") # print is a function (more later) \\nExecute this file (.py file) by typing python hello.py and you will see Hello World printed \\non the screen. \\nMODULES \\nA module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) which can be \\nimported and used in our programs. \\nPIP \\nPip is the package manager for python. You can use pip to install a module on your \\nsystem. \\npip install flask # Installs Flask Module \\nTYPES OF MODULES \\nThere are two types of modules in Python. \\n1. Built in Modules (Preinstalled in Python) \\n2. External Modules (Need to install using pip) \\nSome examples of built in modules are os, random etc. \\nSome examples of external modules are tensorflow, flask etc. \\nUSING PYTHON AS A CALCULATOR \\nWe can use python as a calculator by typing “python” + ↵ on the terminal. \\nThis opens REPL or Read Evaluate Print Loop. \\nCOMMENTS \\nComments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to \\nexecute. This can be used to mark author name, date etc. \\nTYPES OF COMMENTS \\nThere are two types of comments in python.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '3.0.10 (5.0.18)', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2024-06-16T02:12:11+05:30', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\The Ultimate Python Handbook.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\The Ultimate Python Handbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 61, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': 'Harry Codes', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-06-15T22:44:10+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240615224410+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20240616021211+05'30'\", 'page': 8}, page_content='8 \\n \\n1.

For example. \\na= 30      # variables = container to store a value. \\nb= \"harry\" # keywords = reserved words in python  \\nc= 71.22   # identifiers = class/function/variable name \\nDATA TYPES \\nPrimarily these are the following data types in Python: \\n1. Integers \\n2. Floating point numbers \\n3. Strings \\n4. Booleans  \\n5. None \\nPython is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us. \\na= 71         # identifies a as class <int> \\nb=88.44       # identifies b as class <float> \\nname= \"harry\" # identifies name as class <str> \\nRULES FOR CHOOSING AN IDENTIFIER \\n• A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores. \\n• A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscores. \\n• A variable name can’t start with a digit. \\n• No while space is allowed to be used inside a variable name. \\nExamples of a few variable names are: harry, one8, seven, _seven etc. \\nOPERATORS IN PYTHON \\nFollowing are some common operators in python: \\n1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc. \\n2. Assignment operators:  =, +=, -= etc. \\n3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <,  != etc. \\n4. Logical operators: and, or, not.'), Document(metadata={'producer': '3.0.10 (5.0.18)', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2024-06-16T02:12:11+05:30', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\The Ultimate Python Handbook.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\The Ultimate Python Handbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 61, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': 'Harry Codes', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-06-15T22:44:10+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240615224410+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20240616021211+05'30'\", 'page': 11}, page_content='11 \\n \\nTYPE() FUNCTION AND TYPECASTING.  \\ntype() function is used to find the data type of a given variable in python. \\na = 31  \\ntype(a) # class <int> \\n \\nb = \"31\" \\ntype (b) # class <str> \\nA number can be converted into a string and vice versa (if possible) \\nThere are many functions to convert one data type into another. \\nstr(31)    =>\"31\"   # integer to string conversion \\nint(\"32\")  => 32    # string to integer conversion \\nfloat(32)  => 32.0  # integer to float conversion \\n… and so, on \\nHere \"31\" is a string literal and 31 a numeric literal. \\nINPUT () FUNCTION \\nThis function allows the user to take input from the keyboard as a string. \\nA = input (\"enter name\")   # if a is \"harry\", the user entered harry \\nIt is important to note that the output of input is always a string (even is a number is \\nentered).'), Document(metadata={'producer': '3.0.10 (5.0.18)', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word for Microsoft 365', 'creationdate': '2024-06-16T02:12:11+05:30', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\The Ultimate Python Handbook.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\The Ultimate Python Handbook.pdf', 'total_pages': 61, 'format': 'PDF 1.7', 'title': '', 'author': 'Harry Codes', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2024-06-15T22:44:10+02:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20240615224410+02'00'\", 'creationDate': \"D:20240616021211+05'30'\", 'page': 12}, page_content='12 \\n \\nCHAPTER 2 – PRACTICE SET \\n1.

For\\nexample, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text ﬁles, or rename and\\nrearrange a bunch of photo ﬁles in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database,\\nor a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.\\nIf you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but\\nﬁnd the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such\\na library and ﬁnd writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could\\nuse an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your\\napplication.\\nPython is just the language for you.\\nYou could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch ﬁles for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best\\nat moving around ﬁles and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could\\nwrite a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a ﬁrst-draft program.\\nPython is simpler to use, available on Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you\\nget the job done more quickly.\\nPython is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, oﬀering much more structure and support\\nfor large programs than shell scripts or batch ﬁles can oﬀer. On the other hand, Python also oﬀers much\\nmore error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such\\nas ﬂexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much\\nlarger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those\\nlanguages.\\nPython allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It\\ncomes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as\\nexamples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like ﬁle I/O, system\\ncalls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.\\nPython is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development\\nbecause no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it\\neasy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during\\nbottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.\\nPython enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically\\nmuch shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:\\n• the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;\\n• statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;\\n• no variable or argument declarations are necessary.\\nPython is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module\\nto the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to\\nlibraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-speciﬁc graphics library).

(E.g., /usr/local/python\\nis a popular alternative location.)\\nOn Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python37\\\\, though \\nyou can change this when you’re running the installer. To add this directory to your path, you can \\ntype the following command into the command prompt in a DOS box:\\nset path=%path%;C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Python37\\\\\\nTyping an end-of-ﬁle character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes\\nthe interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing\\nthe following command: quit().\\nThe interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion\\non systems that support readline.\\nPerhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is\\nsupported is typing Control-P to the ﬁrst Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line\\nediting; see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If\\nnothing appears to happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to\\nuse backspace to remove characters from the current line.\\nThe interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty\\ndevice, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a ﬁle name argument or with a ﬁle\\nas standard input, it reads and executes a script from that ﬁle.\\nA second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s)\\nin command, analogous to the shell’s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other\\ncharacters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety with single\\nquotes.\\nSome Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using python -m module [arg] ...,\\nwhich executes the source ﬁle for module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.\\nWhen a script ﬁle is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode\\nafterwards. This can be done by passing -i before the script.\\n1 On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named python, so that it does not\\nconﬂict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 11}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nAll command line options are described in using-on-general.\\n2.1.1 Argument Passing\\nWhen known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list\\nof strings and assigned to the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list by executing import\\nsys. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, sys.argv[0] is an\\nempty string. When the script name is given as \\'-\\' (meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to \\'-\\'.\\nWhen -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to \\'-c\\'. When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to\\nthe full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by\\nthe Python interpreter’s option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle.\\n2.1.2 Interactive Mode\\nWhen commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts\\nfor the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines\\nit prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message\\nstating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the ﬁrst prompt:\\n$ python3.7\\nPython 3.7 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04)\\n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux\\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\\n>>>\\nContinuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct.

To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the ﬁle is UTF-8, and it\\nmust use a font that supports all the characters in the ﬁle.\\nTo declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the ﬁrst line\\nof the ﬁle.

For instance,\\nwe can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:\\n>>> # Fibonacci series:\\n... # the sum of two elements defines the next\\n... a, b = 0, 1\\n>>> while a < 10:\\n...\\nprint(a)\\n...\\na, b = b, a+b\\n...\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n5\\n8\\nThis example introduces several new features.\\n• The ﬁrst line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values\\n0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side\\nare all evaluated ﬁrst before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are\\nevaluated from the left to the right.\\n• The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true. In Python, like in C,\\nany non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in\\nfact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used\\nin the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in\\nC: < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal\\nto) and != (not equal to).\\n• The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive\\nprompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more\\ncomplicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility.\\nWhen a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate\\ncompletion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line\\nwithin a basic block must be indented by the same amount.\\n• The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given.\\nIt diﬀers from just writing\\nthe expression you want to write (as we did earlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles\\nmultiple arguments, ﬂoating point quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a\\nspace is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like this:\\n16\\nChapter 3.\\nAn Informal Introduction to Python\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 22}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n>>> i = 256*256\\n>>> print('The value of i is', i)\\nThe value of i is 65536\\nThe keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with\\na diﬀerent string:\\n>>> a, b = 0, 1\\n>>> while a < 1000:\\n...\\nprint(a, end=',')\\n...\\na, b = b, a+b\\n...\\n0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,\\n3.2.\\nFirst Steps Towards Programming\\n17\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 23}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n18\\nChapter 3.\\nAn Informal Introduction to Python'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 24}, page_content='CHAPTER\\nFOUR\\nMORE CONTROL FLOW TOOLS\\nBesides the while statement just introduced, Python knows the usual control ﬂow statements known from\\nother languages, with some twists.\\n4.1 if Statements\\nPerhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:\\n>>> x = int(input(\"Please enter an integer: \"))\\nPlease enter an integer: 42\\n>>> if x < 0:\\n...\\nx = 0\\n...\\nprint(\\'Negative changed to zero\\')\\n... elif x == 0:\\n...\\nprint(\\'Zero\\')\\n... elif x == 1:\\n...\\nprint(\\'Single\\')\\n... else:\\n...\\nprint(\\'More\\')\\n...\\nMore\\nThere can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional.

An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the\\nswitch or case statements found in other languages.\\n4.2 for Statements\\nThe for statement in Python diﬀers a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always\\niterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to deﬁne\\nboth the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any\\nsequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun intended):\\n>>> # Measure some strings:\\n... words = [\\'cat\\', \\'window\\', \\'defenestrate\\']\\n>>> for w in words:\\n...\\nprint(w, len(w))\\n...\\ncat 3\\nwindow 6\\ndefenestrate 12\\n19'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 25}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nIf you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate\\nselected items), it is recommended that you ﬁrst make a copy. Iterating over a sequence does not implicitly\\nmake a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:\\n>>> for w in words[:]:\\n# Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.\\n...\\nif len(w) > 6:\\n...\\nwords.insert(0, w)\\n...\\n>>> words\\n['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']\\nWith for w in words:, the example would attempt to create an inﬁnite list, inserting defenestrate over\\nand over again.\\n4.3 The range() Function\\nIf you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy. It\\ngenerates arithmetic progressions:\\n>>> for i in range(5):\\n...\\nprint(i)\\n...\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nThe given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices\\nfor items of a sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a\\ndiﬀerent increment (even negative; sometimes this is called the ‘step’):\\nrange(5, 10)\\n5, 6, 7, 8, 9\\nrange(0, 10, 3)\\n0, 3, 6, 9\\nrange(-10, -100, -30)\\n-10, -40, -70\\nTo iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len() as follows:\\n>>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']\\n>>> for i in range(len(a)):\\n...\\nprint(i, a[i])\\n...\\n0 Mary\\n1 had\\n2 a\\n3 little\\n4 lamb\\nIn most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the enumerate() function, see Looping Techniques.\\nA strange thing happens if you just print a range:\\n20\\nChapter 4.\\nMore Control Flow Tools\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 26}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n>>> print(range(10))\\nrange(0, 10)\\nIn many ways the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a list, but in fact it isn’t. It is an object\\nwhich returns the successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesn’t really\\nmake the list, thus saving space.\\nWe say such an object is iterable, that is, suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect\\nsomething from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen that\\nthe for statement is such an iterator. The function list() is another; it creates lists from iterables:\\n>>> list(range(5))\\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\\nLater we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as argument.\\n4.4 break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops\\nThe break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop.\\nLoop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop terminates through exhaustion of\\nthe list (with for) or when the condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated\\nby a break statement. This is exempliﬁed by the following loop, which searches for prime numbers:\\n>>> for n in range(2, 10):\\n...\\nfor x in range(2, n):\\n...\\nif n % x == 0:\\n...\\nprint(n, \\'equals\\', x, \\'*\\', n//x)\\n...\\nbreak\\n...\\nelse:\\n...\\n# loop fell through without finding a factor\\n...\\nprint(n, \\'is a prime number\\')\\n...\\n2 is a prime number\\n3 is a prime number\\n4 equals 2 * 2\\n5 is a prime number\\n6 equals 2 * 3\\n7 is a prime number\\n8 equals 2 * 4\\n9 equals 3 * 3\\n(Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs to the for loop, not the if statement.)\\nWhen used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it\\ndoes that of if statements: a try statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a loop’s else\\nclause runs when no break occurs. For more on the try statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions.\\nThe continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next iteration of the loop:\\n>>> for num in range(2, 10):\\n...\\nif num % 2 == 0:\\n...\\nprint(\"Found an even number\", num)\\n...\\ncontinue\\n...\\nprint(\"Found a number\", num)\\nFound an even number 2\\n(continues on next page)\\n4.4.\\nbreak and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops\\n21'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 27}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\nFound a number 3\\nFound an even number 4\\nFound a number 5\\nFound an even number 6\\nFound a number 7\\nFound an even number 8\\nFound a number 9\\n4.5 pass Statements\\nThe pass statement does nothing.

The pass is silently ignored:\\n>>> def initlog(*args):\\n...\\npass\\n# Remember to implement this!\\n...\\n4.6 Deﬁning Functions\\nWe can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary:\\n>>> def fib(n):\\n# write Fibonacci series up to n\\n...\\n\"\"\"Print a Fibonacci series up to n.\"\"\"\\n...\\na, b = 0, 1\\n...\\nwhile a < n:\\n...\\nprint(a, end=\\' \\')\\n...\\na, b = b, a+b\\n...\\nprint()\\n...\\n>>> # Now call the function we just defined:\\n... fib(2000)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597\\nThe keyword def introduces a function deﬁnition.\\nIt must be followed by the function name and the\\nparenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next\\nline, and must be indented.\\nThe ﬁrst statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function’s\\ndocumentation string, or docstring. (More about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation\\n22\\nChapter 4.\\nMore Control Flow Tools'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 28}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nStrings.) There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation,\\nor to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good practice to include docstrings in code that you\\nwrite, so make a habit of it.\\nThe execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More\\nprecisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable\\nreferences ﬁrst look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in\\nthe global symbol table, and ﬁnally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly\\nassigned a value within a function (unless named in a global statement), although they may be referenced.\\nThe actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called\\nfunction when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object\\nreference, not the value of the object).1 When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is\\ncreated for that call.\\nA function deﬁnition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the function\\nname has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-deﬁned function. This value can be assigned\\nto another name which can then also be used as a function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism:\\n>>> fib\\n<function fib at 10042ed0>\\n>>> f = fib\\n>>> f(100)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89\\nComing from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but a procedure since it doesn’t\\nreturn a value. In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring\\none. This value is called None (it’s a built-in name). Writing the value None is normally suppressed by the\\ninterpreter if it would be the only value written. You can see it if you really want to using print():\\n>>> fib(0)\\n>>> print(fib(0))\\nNone\\nIt is simple to write a function that returns a list of the numbers of the Fibonacci series, instead of printing\\nit:\\n>>> def fib2(n):\\n# return Fibonacci series up to n\\n...\\n\"\"\"Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n.\"\"\"\\n...\\nresult = []\\n...\\na, b = 0, 1\\n...\\nwhile a < n:\\n...\\nresult.append(a)\\n# see below\\n...\\na, b = b, a+b\\n...\\nreturn result\\n...\\n>>> f100 = fib2(100)\\n# call it\\n>>> f100\\n# write the result\\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]\\nThis example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features:\\n• The return statement returns with a value from a function. return without an expression argument\\nreturns None. Falling oﬀthe end of a function also returns None.\\n• The statement result.append(a) calls a method of the list object result. A method is a function\\nthat ‘belongs’ to an object and is named obj.methodname, where obj is some object (this may be an\\n1 Actually, call by object reference would be a better description, since if a mutable object is passed, the caller will see any\\nchanges the callee makes to it (items inserted into a list).\\n4.6.\\nDeﬁning Functions\\n23'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 29}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nexpression), and methodname is the name of a method that is deﬁned by the object’s type. Diﬀerent\\ntypes deﬁne diﬀerent methods. Methods of diﬀerent types may have the same name without causing\\nambiguity. (It is possible to deﬁne your own object types and methods, using classes, see Classes) The\\nmethod append() shown in the example is deﬁned for list objects; it adds a new element at the end of\\nthe list. In this example it is equivalent to result = result + [a], but more eﬃcient.\\n4.7 More on Deﬁning Functions\\nIt is also possible to deﬁne functions with a variable number of arguments. There are three forms, which\\ncan be combined.\\n4.7.1 Default Argument Values\\nThe most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments. This creates a function that\\ncan be called with fewer arguments than it is deﬁned to allow. For example:\\ndef ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):\\nwhile True:\\nok = input(prompt)\\nif ok in ('y', 'ye', 'yes'):\\nreturn True\\nif ok in ('n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'):\\nreturn False\\nretries = retries - 1\\nif retries < 0:\\nraise ValueError('invalid user response')\\nprint(reminder)\\nThis function can be called in several ways:\\n• giving only the mandatory argument: ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')\\n• giving one of the optional arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)\\n• or even giving all arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or\\nno!')\\nThis example also introduces the in keyword. This tests whether or not a sequence contains a certain value.\\nThe default values are evaluated at the point of function deﬁnition in the deﬁning scope, so that\\ni = 5\\ndef f(arg=i):\\nprint(arg)\\ni = 6\\nf()\\nwill print 5.\\nImportant warning: The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a diﬀerence when the default is\\na mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or instances of most classes. For example, the following function\\naccumulates the arguments passed to it on subsequent calls:\\n24\\nChapter 4.\\nMore Control Flow Tools\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 30}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\ndef f(a, L=[]):\\nL.append(a)\\nreturn L\\nprint(f(1))\\nprint(f(2))\\nprint(f(3))\\nThis will print\\n[1]\\n[1, 2]\\n[1, 2, 3]\\nIf you don’t want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can write the function like this\\ninstead:\\ndef f(a, L=None):\\nif L is None:\\nL = []\\nL.append(a)\\nreturn L\\n4.7.2 Keyword Arguments\\nFunctions can also be called using keyword arguments of the form kwarg=value. For instance, the following\\nfunction:\\ndef parrot(voltage, state=\\'a stiff\\', action=\\'voom\\', type=\\'Norwegian Blue\\'):\\nprint(\"-- This parrot wouldn\\'t\", action, end=\\' \\')\\nprint(\"if you put\", voltage, \"volts through it.\")\\nprint(\"-- Lovely plumage, the\", type)\\nprint(\"-- It\\'s\", state, \"!\")\\naccepts one required argument (voltage) and three optional arguments (state, action, and type). This\\nfunction can be called in any of the following ways:\\nparrot(1000)\\n# 1 positional argument\\nparrot(voltage=1000)\\n# 1 keyword argument\\nparrot(voltage=1000000, action=\\'VOOOOOM\\')\\n# 2 keyword arguments\\nparrot(action=\\'VOOOOOM\\', voltage=1000000)\\n# 2 keyword arguments\\nparrot(\\'a million\\', \\'bereft of life\\', \\'jump\\')\\n# 3 positional arguments\\nparrot(\\'a thousand\\', state=\\'pushing up the daisies\\')\\n# 1 positional, 1 keyword\\nbut all the following calls would be invalid:\\nparrot()\\n# required argument missing\\nparrot(voltage=5.0, \\'dead\\')\\n# non-keyword argument after a keyword argument\\nparrot(110, voltage=220)\\n# duplicate value for the same argument\\nparrot(actor=\\'John Cleese\\')\\n# unknown keyword argument\\nIn a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments.\\nAll the keyword arguments\\npassed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function (e.g. actor is not a valid argument\\nfor the parrot function), and their order is not important. This also includes non-optional arguments (e.g.\\nparrot(voltage=1000) is valid too). No argument may receive a value more than once.

For instance, the built-in range() function expects\\nseparate start and stop arguments. If they are not available separately, write the function call with the\\n*-operator to unpack the arguments out of a list or tuple:\\n>>> list(range(3, 6))\\n# normal call with separate arguments\\n[3, 4, 5]\\n>>> args = [3, 6]\\n>>> list(range(*args))\\n# call with arguments unpacked from a list\\n[3, 4, 5]\\nIn the same fashion, dictionaries can deliver keyword arguments with the **-operator:\\n>>> def parrot(voltage, state=\\'a stiff\\', action=\\'voom\\'):\\n...\\nprint(\"-- This parrot wouldn\\'t\", action, end=\\' \\')\\n...\\nprint(\"if you put\", voltage, \"volts through it.\", end=\\' \\')\\n...\\nprint(\"E\\'s\", state, \"!\")\\n...\\n>>> d = {\"voltage\": \"four million\", \"state\": \"bleedin\\' demised\", \"action\": \"VOOM\"}\\n>>> parrot(**d)\\n-- This parrot wouldn\\'t VOOM if you put four million volts through it. E\\'s bleedin\\' demised !\\n4.7.5 Lambda Expressions\\nSmall anonymous functions can be created with the lambda keyword. This function returns the sum of its\\ntwo arguments: lambda a, b: a+b. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.\\nThey are syntactically restricted to a single expression. Semantically, they are just syntactic sugar for a\\nnormal function deﬁnition. Like nested function deﬁnitions, lambda functions can reference variables from\\nthe containing scope:\\n>>> def make_incrementor(n):\\n...\\nreturn lambda x: x + n\\n...\\n>>> f = make_incrementor(42)\\n>>> f(0)\\n42\\n>>> f(1)\\n43\\nThe above example uses a lambda expression to return a function.

For brevity, it should\\nnot explicitly state the object’s name or type, since these are available by other means (except if the name\\nhappens to be a verb describing a function’s operation). This line should begin with a capital letter and end\\nwith a period.\\nIf there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be blank, visually separating the\\nsummary from the rest of the description. The following lines should be one or more paragraphs describing\\nthe object’s calling conventions, its side eﬀects, etc.\\nThe Python parser does not strip indentation from multi-line string literals in Python, so tools that process\\ndocumentation have to strip indentation if desired.\\nThis is done using the following convention.\\nThe\\nﬁrst non-blank line after the ﬁrst line of the string determines the amount of indentation for the entire\\ndocumentation string. (We can’t use the ﬁrst line since it is generally adjacent to the string’s opening quotes\\nso its indentation is not apparent in the string literal.) Whitespace “equivalent” to this indentation is then\\nstripped from the start of all lines of the string. Lines that are indented less should not occur, but if they\\noccur all their leading whitespace should be stripped.\\nEquivalence of whitespace should be tested after\\nexpansion of tabs (to 8 spaces, normally).\\nHere is an example of a multi-line docstring:\\n>>> def my_function():\\n...\\n\"\"\"Do nothing, but document it.\\n...\\n...\\nNo, really, it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n...\\n\"\"\"\\n...\\npass\\n...\\n>>> print(my_function.__doc__)\\nDo nothing, but document it.\\nNo, really, it doesn\\'t do anything.\\n4.7.7 Function Annotations\\nFunction annotations are completely optional metadata information about the types used by user-deﬁned\\nfunctions (see PEP 3107 and PEP 484 for more information).\\nAnnotations are stored in the __annotations__ attribute of the function as a dictionary and have no eﬀect\\non any other part of the function. Parameter annotations are deﬁned by a colon after the parameter name,\\nfollowed by an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation. Return annotations are deﬁned by a\\nliteral ->, followed by an expression, between the parameter list and the colon denoting the end of the def\\nstatement. The following example has a positional argument, a keyword argument, and the return value\\nannotated:\\n>>> def f(ham: str, eggs: str = \\'eggs\\') -> str:\\n...\\nprint(\"Annotations:\", f.__annotations__)\\n(continues on next page)\\n28\\nChapter 4.\\nMore Control Flow Tools'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 34}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\n...\\nprint(\"Arguments:\", ham, eggs)\\n...\\nreturn ham + \\' and \\' + eggs\\n...\\n>>> f(\\'spam\\')\\nAnnotations: {\\'ham\\': <class \\'str\\'>, \\'return\\': <class \\'str\\'>, \\'eggs\\': <class \\'str\\'>}\\nArguments: spam eggs\\n\\'spam and eggs\\'\\n4.8 Intermezzo: Coding Style\\nNow that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a good time to talk about\\ncoding style. Most languages can be written (or more concise, formatted) in diﬀerent styles; some are more\\nreadable than others. Making it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting a nice\\ncoding style helps tremendously for that.\\nFor Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to; it promotes a very\\nreadable and eye-pleasing coding style. Every Python developer should read it at some point; here are the\\nmost important points extracted for you:\\n• Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs.\\n4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater nesting depth) and large\\nindentation (easier to read). Tabs introduce confusion, and are best left out.\\n• Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters.\\nThis helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several code ﬁles side-by-side on\\nlarger displays.\\n• Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of code inside functions.\\n• When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\\n• Use docstrings.\\n• Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside bracketing constructs: a =\\nf(1, 2) + g(3, 4).\\n• Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and\\nlower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods. Always use self as the name for the ﬁrst\\nmethod argument (see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\\n• Don’t use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international environments. Python’s\\ndefault, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any case.\\n• Likewise, don’t use non-ASCII characters in identiﬁers if there is only the slightest chance people\\nspeaking a diﬀerent language will read or maintain the code.\\n4.8.\\nIntermezzo: Coding Style\\n29'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 35}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n30\\nChapter 4.\\nMore Control Flow Tools'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 36}, page_content='CHAPTER\\nFIVE\\nDATA STRUCTURES\\nThis chapter describes some things you’ve learned about already in more detail, and adds some new things\\nas well.\\n5.1 More on Lists\\nThe list data type has some more methods.

It raises a ValueError if there is no such\\nitem.\\nlist.pop([i])\\nRemove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is speciﬁed, a.pop() removes\\nand returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the method signature denote\\nthat the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets at that position. You will see\\nthis notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)\\nlist.clear()\\nRemove all items from the list.

While appends and pops from the end of list are\\nfast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other elements have to be\\nshifted by one).\\nTo implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to have fast appends and pops from\\nboth ends. For example:\\n>>> from collections import deque\\n>>> queue = deque([\"Eric\", \"John\", \"Michael\"])\\n>>> queue.append(\"Terry\")\\n# Terry arrives\\n>>> queue.append(\"Graham\")\\n# Graham arrives\\n>>> queue.popleft()\\n# The first to arrive now leaves\\n\\'Eric\\'\\n>>> queue.popleft()\\n# The second to arrive now leaves\\n\\'John\\'\\n>>> queue\\n# Remaining queue in order of arrival\\ndeque([\\'Michael\\', \\'Terry\\', \\'Graham\\'])\\n5.1.3 List Comprehensions\\nList comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists where\\neach element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to\\ncreate a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.\\nFor example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:\\n>>> squares = []\\n>>> for x in range(10):\\n...\\nsquares.append(x**2)\\n...\\n>>> squares\\n[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\\nNote that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named x that still exists after the loop completes. We can\\ncalculate the list of squares without any side eﬀects using:\\nsquares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))\\nor, equivalently:\\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\\nwhich is more concise and readable.\\nA list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or\\nmore for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context\\nof the for and if clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if\\nthey are not equal:\\n>>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]\\n[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\\nand it’s equivalent to:\\n5.1.\\nMore on Lists\\n33'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 39}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n>>> combs = []\\n>>> for x in [1,2,3]:\\n...\\nfor y in [3,1,4]:\\n...\\nif x != y:\\n...\\ncombs.append((x, y))\\n...\\n>>> combs\\n[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\\nNote how the order of the for and if statements is the same in both these snippets.\\nIf the expression is a tuple (e.g. the (x, y) in the previous example), it must be parenthesized.\\n>>> vec = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]\\n>>> # create a new list with the values doubled\\n>>> [x*2 for x in vec]\\n[-8, -4, 0, 4, 8]\\n>>> # filter the list to exclude negative numbers\\n>>> [x for x in vec if x >= 0]\\n[0, 2, 4]\\n>>> # apply a function to all the elements\\n>>> [abs(x) for x in vec]\\n[4, 2, 0, 2, 4]\\n>>> # call a method on each element\\n>>> freshfruit = [\\'\\nbanana\\', \\'\\nloganberry \\', \\'passion fruit\\n\\']\\n>>> [weapon.strip() for weapon in freshfruit]\\n[\\'banana\\', \\'loganberry\\', \\'passion fruit\\']\\n>>> # create a list of 2-tuples like (number, square)\\n>>> [(x, x**2) for x in range(6)]\\n[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]\\n>>> # the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised\\n>>> [x, x**2 for x in range(6)]\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\n[x, x**2 for x in range(6)]\\n^\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\n>>> # flatten a list using a listcomp with two \\'for\\'\\n>>> vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]\\n>>> [num for elem in vec for num in elem]\\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\\nList comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions:\\n>>> from math import pi\\n>>> [str(round(pi, i)) for i in range(1, 6)]\\n[\\'3.1\\', \\'3.14\\', \\'3.142\\', \\'3.1416\\', \\'3.14159\\']\\n5.1.4 Nested List Comprehensions\\nThe initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression, including another list com-\\nprehension.\\nConsider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length 4:\\n>>> matrix = [\\n...\\n[1, 2, 3, 4],\\n...\\n[5, 6, 7, 8],\\n(continues on next page)\\n34\\nChapter 5.\\nData Structures'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 40}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\n...\\n[9, 10, 11, 12],\\n... ]\\nThe following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns:\\n>>> [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]\\n[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\nAs we saw in the previous section, the nested listcomp is evaluated in the context of the for that follows it,\\nso this example is equivalent to:\\n>>> transposed = []\\n>>> for i in range(4):\\n...\\ntransposed.append([row[i] for row in matrix])\\n...\\n>>> transposed\\n[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\nwhich, in turn, is the same as:\\n>>> transposed = []\\n>>> for i in range(4):\\n...\\n# the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp\\n...\\ntransposed_row = []\\n...\\nfor row in matrix:\\n...\\ntransposed_row.append(row[i])\\n...\\ntransposed.append(transposed_row)\\n...\\n>>> transposed\\n[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\\nIn the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex ﬂow statements.

We’ll ﬁnd other\\nuses for del later.\\n5.3 Tuples and Sequences\\nWe saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations. They\\nare two examples of sequence data types (see typesseq). Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence\\ndata types may be added. There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple.\\nA tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:\\n>>> t = 12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\'\\n>>> t[0]\\n12345\\n>>> t\\n(12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\')\\n>>> # Tuples may be nested:\\n... u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\\n>>> u\\n((12345, 54321, \\'hello!\\'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\\n>>> # Tuples are immutable:\\n... t[0] = 88888\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: \\'tuple\\' object does not support item assignment\\n>>> # but they can contain mutable objects:\\n... v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\\n>>> v\\n([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\\nAs you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted\\ncorrectly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses are\\nnecessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign to the individual\\nitems of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable objects, such as lists.\\nThough tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in diﬀerent situations and for diﬀerent purposes.\\nTuples are immutable, and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of elements that are accessed via\\nunpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples). Lists are\\nmutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed by iterating over the list.\\nA special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra quirks to\\naccommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is\\nconstructed by following a value with a comma (it is not suﬃcient to enclose a single value in parentheses).\\nUgly, but eﬀective. For example:\\n>>> empty = ()\\n>>> singleton = \\'hello\\',\\n# <-- note trailing comma\\n>>> len(empty)\\n(continues on next page)\\n36\\nChapter 5.\\nData Structures'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 42}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\n0\\n>>> len(singleton)\\n1\\n>>> singleton\\n('hello',)\\nThe statement t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' is an example of tuple packing: the values 12345, 54321 and\\n'hello!' are packed together in a tuple. The reverse operation is also possible:\\n>>> x, y, z = t\\nThis is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand side.\\nSequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are\\nelements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple packing and\\nsequence unpacking.\\n5.4 Sets\\nPython also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic\\nuses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support mathematical\\noperations like union, intersection, diﬀerence, and symmetric diﬀerence.\\nCurly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have to use\\nset(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.\\nHere is a brief demonstration:\\n>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}\\n>>> print(basket)\\n# show that duplicates have been removed\\n{'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}\\n>>> 'orange' in basket\\n# fast membership testing\\nTrue\\n>>> 'crabgrass' in basket\\nFalse\\n>>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words\\n...\\n>>> a = set('abracadabra')\\n>>> b = set('alacazam')\\n>>> a\\n# unique letters in a\\n{'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}\\n>>> a - b\\n# letters in a but not in b\\n{'r', 'd', 'b'}\\n>>> a | b\\n# letters in a or b or both\\n{'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}\\n>>> a & b\\n# letters in both a and b\\n{'a', 'c'}\\n>>> a ^ b\\n# letters in a or b but not both\\n{'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}\\nSimilarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:\\n>>> a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}\\n>>> a\\n{'r', 'd'}\\n5.4.\\nSets\\n37\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 43}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n5.5 Dictionaries\\nAnother useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see typesmapping). Dictionaries are sometimes\\nfound in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike sequences, which are\\nindexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings\\nand numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples;\\nif a tuple contains any mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use\\nlists as keys, since lists can be modiﬁed in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like\\nappend() and extend().\\nIt is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique\\n(within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated\\nlist of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way\\ndictionaries are written on output.\\nThe main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the\\nkey. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that is already in use,\\nthe old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract a value using a non-existent key.\\nPerforming list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in insertion order\\n(if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d) instead).

All comparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all\\nnumerical operators.\\nComparisons can be chained. For example, a < b == c tests whether a is less than b and moreover b equals\\nc.\\nComparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and and or, and the outcome of a comparison\\n(or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated with not. These have lower priorities than comparison\\noperators; between them, not has the highest priority and or the lowest, so that A and not B or C is\\nequivalent to (A and (not B)) or C. As always, parentheses can be used to express the desired composition.\\nThe Boolean operators and and or are so-called short-circuit operators: their arguments are evaluated from\\nleft to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example, if A and C are true\\nbut B is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression C. When used as a general value and not as\\na Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument.\\nIt is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable. For example,\\n>>> string1, string2, string3 = '', 'Trondheim', 'Hammer Dance'\\n>>> non_null = string1 or string2 or string3\\n>>> non_null\\n'Trondheim'\\nNote that in Python, unlike C, assignment cannot occur inside expressions. C programmers may grumble\\nabout this, but it avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing = in an expression\\nwhen == was intended.\\n5.8 Comparing Sequences and Other Types\\nSequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses lex-\\nicographical ordering: ﬁrst the ﬁrst two items are compared, and if they diﬀer this determines the outcome\\nof the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until either sequence is\\nexhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical com-\\nparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered\\nequal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser)\\n40\\nChapter 5.\\nData Structures\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 46}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\none.

Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better oﬀusing a\\ntext editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that ﬁle as input instead. This is\\nknown as creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several ﬁles for easier\\nmaintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without\\ncopying its deﬁnition into each program.\\nTo support this, Python has a way to put deﬁnitions in a ﬁle and use them in a script or in an interactive\\ninstance of the interpreter. Such a ﬁle is called a module; deﬁnitions from a module can be imported into\\nother modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed\\nat the top level and in calculator mode).\\nA module is a ﬁle containing Python deﬁnitions and statements. The ﬁle name is the module name with\\nthe suﬃx .py appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the\\nglobal variable __name__. For instance, use your favorite text editor to create a ﬁle called fibo.py in the\\ncurrent directory with the following contents:\\n# Fibonacci numbers module\\ndef fib(n):\\n# write Fibonacci series up to n\\na, b = 0, 1\\nwhile a < n:\\nprint(a, end=' ')\\na, b = b, a+b\\nprint()\\ndef fib2(n):\\n# return Fibonacci series up to n\\nresult = []\\na, b = 0, 1\\nwhile a < n:\\nresult.append(a)\\na, b = b, a+b\\nreturn result\\nNow enter the Python interpreter and import this module with the following command:\\n>>> import fibo\\nThis does not enter the names of the functions deﬁned in fibo directly in the current symbol table; it only\\nenters the module name fibo there. Using the module name you can access the functions:\\n>>> fibo.fib(1000)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987\\n>>> fibo.fib2(100)\\n(continues on next page)\\n43\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 49}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]\\n>>> fibo.__name__\\n'fibo'\\nIf you intend to use a function often you can assign it to a local name:\\n>>> fib = fibo.fib\\n>>> fib(500)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n6.1 More on Modules\\nA module can contain executable statements as well as function deﬁnitions. These statements are intended\\nto initialize the module. They are executed only the ﬁrst time the module name is encountered in an import\\nstatement.1 (They are also run if the ﬁle is executed as a script.)\\nEach module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions\\ndeﬁned in the module.\\nThus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without\\nworrying about accidental clashes with a user’s global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you\\nare doing you can touch a module’s global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions,\\nmodname.itemname.\\nModules can import other modules. It is customary but not required to place all import statements at the\\nbeginning of a module (or script, for that matter). The imported module names are placed in the importing\\nmodule’s global symbol table.\\nThere is a variant of the import statement that imports names from a module directly into the importing\\nmodule’s symbol table. For example:\\n>>> from fibo import fib, fib2\\n>>> fib(500)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\nThis does not introduce the module name from which the imports are taken in the local symbol table (so in\\nthe example, fibo is not deﬁned).\\nThere is even a variant to import all names that a module deﬁnes:\\n>>> from fibo import *\\n>>> fib(500)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\nThis imports all names except those beginning with an underscore (_). In most cases Python programmers\\ndo not use this facility since it introduces an unknown set of names into the interpreter, possibly hiding some\\nthings you have already deﬁned.\\nNote that in general the practice of importing * from a module or package is frowned upon, since it often\\ncauses poorly readable code. However, it is okay to use it to save typing in interactive sessions.\\nIf the module name is followed by as, then the name following as is bound directly to the imported module.\\n>>> import fibo as fib\\n>>> fib.fib(500)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\n1 In fact function deﬁnitions are also ‘statements’ that are ‘executed’; the execution of a module-level function deﬁnition\\nenters the function name in the module’s global symbol table.\\n44\\nChapter 6.\\nModules\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 50}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nThis is eﬀectively importing the module in the same way that import fibo will do, with the only diﬀerence\\nof it being available as fib.\\nIt can also be used when utilising from with similar eﬀects:\\n>>> from fibo import fib as fibonacci\\n>>> fibonacci(500)\\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377\\nNote:\\nFor eﬃciency reasons, each module is only imported once per interpreter session.

The directory containing the script being run\\nis placed at the beginning of the search path, ahead of the standard library path. This means that scripts in\\nthat directory will be loaded instead of modules of the same name in the library directory. This is an error\\nunless the replacement is intended. See section Standard Modules for more information.\\n6.1.3 “Compiled” Python ﬁles\\nTo speed up loading modules, Python caches the compiled version of each module in the __pycache__\\ndirectory under the name module.version.pyc, where the version encodes the format of the compiled ﬁle;\\nit generally contains the Python version number. For example, in CPython release 3.3 the compiled version of\\nspam.py would be cached as __pycache__/spam.cpython-33.pyc. This naming convention allows compiled\\nmodules from diﬀerent releases and diﬀerent versions of Python to coexist.\\nPython checks the modiﬁcation date of the source against the compiled version to see if it’s out of date\\nand needs to be recompiled.\\nThis is a completely automatic process.\\nAlso, the compiled modules are\\nplatform-independent, so the same library can be shared among systems with diﬀerent architectures.\\nPython does not check the cache in two circumstances. First, it always recompiles and does not store the\\nresult for the module that’s loaded directly from the command line. Second, it does not check the cache if\\nthere is no source module. To support a non-source (compiled only) distribution, the compiled module must\\nbe in the source directory, and there must not be a source module.\\nSome tips for experts:\\n• You can use the -O or -OO switches on the Python command to reduce the size of a compiled module.\\nThe -O switch removes assert statements, the -OO switch removes both assert statements and __doc__\\nstrings. Since some programs may rely on having these available, you should only use this option if\\nyou know what you’re doing. “Optimized” modules have an opt- tag and are usually smaller. Future\\nreleases may change the eﬀects of optimization.\\n• A program doesn’t run any faster when it is read from a .pyc ﬁle than when it is read from a .py ﬁle;\\nthe only thing that’s faster about .pyc ﬁles is the speed with which they are loaded.\\n• The module compileall can create .pyc ﬁles for all modules in a directory.\\n• There is more detail on this process, including a ﬂow chart of the decisions, in PEP 3147.\\n6.2 Standard Modules\\nPython comes with a library of standard modules, described in a separate document, the Python Library\\nReference (“Library Reference” hereafter). Some modules are built into the interpreter; these provide access\\nto operations that are not part of the core of the language but are nevertheless built in, either for eﬃciency\\nor to provide access to operating system primitives such as system calls.\\nThe set of such modules is a\\nconﬁguration option which also depends on the underlying platform. For example, the winreg module is\\nonly provided on Windows systems. One particular module deserves some attention: sys, which is built\\ninto every Python interpreter. The variables sys.ps1 and sys.ps2 deﬁne the strings used as primary and\\nsecondary prompts:\\n>>> import sys\\n>>> sys.ps1\\n'>>> '\\n>>> sys.ps2\\n'...

For example,\\nthe module name A.B designates a submodule named B in a package named A. Just like the use of modules\\nsaves the authors of diﬀerent modules from having to worry about each other’s global variable names, the\\nuse of dotted module names saves the authors of multi-module packages like NumPy or Pillow from having\\nto worry about each other’s module names.\\nSuppose you want to design a collection of modules (a “package”) for the uniform handling of sound ﬁles and\\nsound data. There are many diﬀerent sound ﬁle formats (usually recognized by their extension, for example:\\n.wav, .aiff, .au), so you may need to create and maintain a growing collection of modules for the conversion\\nbetween the various ﬁle formats. There are also many diﬀerent operations you might want to perform on\\nsound data (such as mixing, adding echo, applying an equalizer function, creating an artiﬁcial stereo eﬀect),\\nso in addition you will be writing a never-ending stream of modules to perform these operations. Here’s a\\npossible structure for your package (expressed in terms of a hierarchical ﬁlesystem):\\nsound/\\nTop-level package\\n__init__.py\\nInitialize the sound package\\nformats/\\nSubpackage for file format conversions\\n__init__.py\\nwavread.py\\nwavwrite.py\\n(continues on next page)\\n48\\nChapter 6.\\nModules\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 54}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\naiffread.py\\naiffwrite.py\\nauread.py\\nauwrite.py\\n...\\neffects/\\nSubpackage for sound effects\\n__init__.py\\necho.py\\nsurround.py\\nreverse.py\\n...\\nfilters/\\nSubpackage for filters\\n__init__.py\\nequalizer.py\\nvocoder.py\\nkaraoke.py\\n...\\nWhen importing the package, Python searches through the directories on sys.path looking for the package\\nsubdirectory.\\nThe __init__.py ﬁles are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done\\nto prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that\\noccur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty ﬁle, but it\\ncan also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.\\nUsers of the package can import individual modules from the package, for example:\\nimport sound.effects.echo\\nThis loads the submodule sound.effects.echo. It must be referenced with its full name.\\nsound.effects.echo.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\nAn alternative way of importing the submodule is:\\nfrom sound.effects import echo\\nThis also loads the submodule echo, and makes it available without its package preﬁx, so it can be used as\\nfollows:\\necho.echofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\nYet another variation is to import the desired function or variable directly:\\nfrom sound.effects.echo import echofilter\\nAgain, this loads the submodule echo, but this makes its function echofilter() directly available:\\nechofilter(input, output, delay=0.7, atten=4)\\nNote that when using from package import item, the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage)\\nof the package, or some other name deﬁned in the package, like a function, class or variable. The import\\nstatement ﬁrst tests whether the item is deﬁned in the package; if not, it assumes it is a module and attempts\\nto load it. If it fails to ﬁnd it, an ImportError exception is raised.\\nContrarily, when using syntax like import item.subitem.subsubitem, each item except for the last must\\nbe a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can’t be a class or function or variable deﬁned\\n6.4.\\nPackages\\n49'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 55}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nin the previous item.\\n6.4.1 Importing * From a Package\\nNow what happens when the user writes from sound.effects import *? Ideally, one would hope that this\\nsomehow goes out to the ﬁlesystem, ﬁnds which submodules are present in the package, and imports them\\nall. This could take a long time and importing sub-modules might have unwanted side-eﬀects that should\\nonly happen when the sub-module is explicitly imported.\\nThe only solution is for the package author to provide an explicit index of the package. The import statement\\nuses the following convention: if a package’s __init__.py code deﬁnes a list named __all__, it is taken to\\nbe the list of module names that should be imported when from package import * is encountered. It is up\\nto the package author to keep this list up-to-date when a new version of the package is released. Package\\nauthors may also decide not to support it, if they don’t see a use for importing * from their package. For\\nexample, the ﬁle sound/effects/__init__.py could contain the following code:\\n__all__ = [\"echo\", \"surround\", \"reverse\"]\\nThis would mean that from sound.effects import * would import the three named submodules of the\\nsound package.\\nIf __all__ is not deﬁned, the statement from sound.effects import * does not import all submodules from\\nthe package sound.effects into the current namespace; it only ensures that the package sound.effects\\nhas been imported (possibly running any initialization code in __init__.py) and then imports whatever\\nnames are deﬁned in the package. This includes any names deﬁned (and submodules explicitly loaded) by\\n__init__.py. It also includes any submodules of the package that were explicitly loaded by previous import\\nstatements. Consider this code:\\nimport sound.effects.echo\\nimport sound.effects.surround\\nfrom sound.effects import *\\nIn this example, the echo and surround modules are imported in the current namespace because they are\\ndeﬁned in the sound.effects package when the from...import statement is executed. (This also works\\nwhen __all__ is deﬁned.)\\nAlthough certain modules are designed to export only names that follow certain patterns when you use\\nimport *, it is still considered bad practice in production code.\\nRemember, there is nothing wrong with using from Package import specific_submodule! In fact, this is\\nthe recommended notation unless the importing module needs to use submodules with the same name from\\ndiﬀerent packages.\\n6.4.2 Intra-package References\\nWhen packages are structured into subpackages (as with the sound package in the example), you can use\\nabsolute imports to refer to submodules of siblings packages. For example, if the module sound.filters.\\nvocoder needs to use the echo module in the sound.effects package, it can use from sound.effects\\nimport echo.\\nYou can also write relative imports, with the from module import name form of import statement. These\\nimports use leading dots to indicate the current and parent packages involved in the relative import.

This chapter will discuss some of the possibilities.\\n7.1 Fancier Output Formatting\\nSo far we’ve encountered two ways of writing values: expression statements and the print() function.\\n(A third way is using the write() method of ﬁle objects; the standard output ﬁle can be referenced as\\nsys.stdout. See the Library Reference for more information on this.)\\nOften you’ll want more control over the formatting of your output than simply printing space-separated\\nvalues. There are several ways to format output.\\n• To use formatted string literals, begin a string with f or F before the opening quotation mark or triple\\nquotation mark. Inside this string, you can write a Python expression between { and } characters that\\ncan refer to variables or literal values.\\n>>> year = 2016 ; event = 'Referendum'\\n>>> f'Results of the {year} {event}'\\n'Results of the 2016 Referendum'\\n• The str.format() method of strings requires more manual eﬀort. You’ll still use { and } to mark\\nwhere a variable will be substituted and can provide detailed formatting directives, but you’ll also need\\nto provide the information to be formatted.\\n>>> yes_votes = 42_572_654 ; no_votes = 43_132_495\\n>>> percentage = yes_votes/(yes_votes+no_votes)\\n>>> '{:-9} YES votes\\n{:2.2%}'.format(yes_votes, percentage)\\n' 42572654 YES votes\\n49.67%'\\n• Finally, you can do all the string handling yourself by using string slicing and concatenation operations\\nto create any layout you can imagine. The string type has some methods that perform useful operations\\nfor padding strings to a given column width.\\nWhen you don’t need fancy output but just want a quick display of some variables for debugging purposes,\\nyou can convert any value to a string with the repr() or str() functions.\\nThe str() function is meant to return representations of values which are fairly human-readable, while\\nrepr() is meant to generate representations which can be read by the interpreter (or will force a SyntaxError\\nif there is no equivalent syntax). For objects which don’t have a particular representation for human con-\\nsumption, str() will return the same value as repr(). Many values, such as numbers or structures like lists\\nand dictionaries, have the same representation using either function.

It understands\\nabout plus and minus signs:\\n>>> '12'.zfill(5)\\n'00012'\\n>>> '-3.14'.zfill(7)\\n'-003.14'\\n>>> '3.14159265359'.zfill(5)\\n'3.14159265359'\\n7.1.4 Old string formatting\\nThe % operator can also be used for string formatting. It interprets the left argument much like a sprintf()-\\nstyle format string to be applied to the right argument, and returns the string resulting from this formatting\\noperation.

The second argument is another string containing a\\nfew characters describing the way in which the ﬁle will be used. mode can be \\'r\\' when the ﬁle will only\\nbe read, \\'w\\' for only writing (an existing ﬁle with the same name will be erased), and \\'a\\' opens the ﬁle\\nfor appending; any data written to the ﬁle is automatically added to the end. \\'r+\\' opens the ﬁle for both\\nreading and writing. The mode argument is optional; \\'r\\' will be assumed if it’s omitted.\\nNormally, ﬁles are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the ﬁle, which are\\nencoded in a speciﬁc encoding. If encoding is not speciﬁed, the default is platform dependent (see open()).\\n\\'b\\' appended to the mode opens the ﬁle in binary mode: now the data is read and written in the form of\\nbytes objects. This mode should be used for all ﬁles that don’t contain text.\\nIn text mode, the default when reading is to convert platform-speciﬁc line endings (\\\\n on Unix, \\\\r\\\\n on\\nWindows) to just \\\\n.\\nWhen writing in text mode, the default is to convert occurrences of \\\\n back to\\nplatform-speciﬁc line endings. This behind-the-scenes modiﬁcation to ﬁle data is ﬁne for text ﬁles, but will\\ncorrupt binary data like that in JPEG or EXE ﬁles. Be very careful to use binary mode when reading and\\nwriting such ﬁles.\\nIt is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with ﬁle objects. The advantage is that the ﬁle is\\nproperly closed after its suite ﬁnishes, even if an exception is raised at some point. Using with is also much\\nshorter than writing equivalent try-finally blocks:\\n>>> with open(\\'workfile\\') as f:\\n...\\nread_data = f.read()\\n>>> f.closed\\nTrue\\nIf you’re not using the with keyword, then you should call f.close() to close the ﬁle and immediately\\nfree up any system resources used by it. If you don’t explicitly close a ﬁle, Python’s garbage collector will\\neventually destroy the object and close the open ﬁle for you, but the ﬁle may stay open for a while. Another\\nrisk is that diﬀerent Python implementations will do this clean-up at diﬀerent times.\\nAfter a ﬁle object is closed, either by a with statement or by calling f.close(), attempts to use the ﬁle\\nobject will automatically fail.\\n>>> f.close()\\n>>> f.read()\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nValueError: I/O operation on closed file.\\n7.2.1 Methods of File Objects\\nThe rest of the examples in this section will assume that a ﬁle object called f has already been created.\\n7.2.\\nReading and Writing Files\\n57'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 63}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nTo read a ﬁle’s contents, call f.read(size), which reads some quantity of data and returns it as a string (in\\ntext mode) or bytes object (in binary mode). size is an optional numeric argument.

Numbers take a bit more eﬀort, since the read()\\nmethod only returns strings, which will have to be passed to a function like int(), which takes a string like\\n\\'123\\' and returns its numeric value 123. When you want to save more complex data types like nested lists\\nand dictionaries, parsing and serializing by hand becomes complicated.\\nRather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to ﬁles,\\nPython allows you to use the popular data interchange format called JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).\\nThe standard module called json can take Python data hierarchies, and convert them to string represen-\\ntations; this process is called serializing. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called\\ndeserializing. Between serializing and deserializing, the string representing the object may have been stored\\nin a ﬁle or data, or sent over a network connection to some distant machine.\\nNote:\\nThe JSON format is commonly used by modern applications to allow for data exchange. Many\\nprogrammers are already familiar with it, which makes it a good choice for interoperability.\\nIf you have an object x, you can view its JSON string representation with a simple line of code:\\n>>> import json\\n>>> json.dumps([1, \\'simple\\', \\'list\\'])\\n\\'[1, \"simple\", \"list\"]\\'\\nAnother variant of the dumps() function, called dump(), simply serializes the object to a text ﬁle. So if f is\\na text ﬁle object opened for writing, we can do this:\\njson.dump(x, f)\\nTo decode the object again, if f is a text ﬁle object which has been opened for reading:\\nx = json.load(f)\\nThis simple serialization technique can handle lists and dictionaries, but serializing arbitrary class instances\\nin JSON requires a bit of extra eﬀort.

There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.\\n8.1 Syntax Errors\\nSyntax errors, also known as parsing errors, are perhaps the most common kind of complaint you get while\\nyou are still learning Python:\\n>>> while True print(\\'Hello world\\')\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1\\nwhile True print(\\'Hello world\\')\\n^\\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\\nThe parser repeats the oﬀending line and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at the earliest point in the line\\nwhere the error was detected. The error is caused by (or at least detected at) the token preceding the arrow:\\nin the example, the error is detected at the function print(), since a colon (\\':\\') is missing before it. File\\nname and line number are printed so you know where to look in case the input came from a script.\\n8.2 Exceptions\\nEven if a statement or expression is syntactically correct, it may cause an error when an attempt is made\\nto execute it. Errors detected during execution are called exceptions and are not unconditionally fatal: you\\nwill soon learn how to handle them in Python programs. Most exceptions are not handled by programs,\\nhowever, and result in error messages as shown here:\\n>>> 10 * (1/0)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\\n>>> 4 + spam*3\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nNameError: name \\'spam\\' is not defined\\n>>> \\'2\\' + 2\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nTypeError: Can\\'t convert \\'int\\' object to str implicitly\\n61'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 67}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nThe last line of the error message indicates what happened. Exceptions come in diﬀerent types, and the\\ntype is printed as part of the message: the types in the example are ZeroDivisionError, NameError and\\nTypeError. The string printed as the exception type is the name of the built-in exception that occurred.\\nThis is true for all built-in exceptions, but need not be true for user-deﬁned exceptions (although it is a\\nuseful convention). Standard exception names are built-in identiﬁers (not reserved keywords).\\nThe rest of the line provides detail based on the type of exception and what caused it.\\nThe preceding part of the error message shows the context where the exception happened, in the form of\\na stack traceback. In general it contains a stack traceback listing source lines; however, it will not display\\nlines read from standard input.\\nbltin-exceptions lists the built-in exceptions and their meanings.\\n8.3 Handling Exceptions\\nIt is possible to write programs that handle selected exceptions. Look at the following example, which asks\\nthe user for input until a valid integer has been entered, but allows the user to interrupt the program (using\\nControl-C or whatever the operating system supports); note that a user-generated interruption is signalled\\nby raising the KeyboardInterrupt exception.\\n>>> while True:\\n...\\ntry:\\n...\\nx = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\\n...\\nbreak\\n...\\nexcept ValueError:\\n...\\nprint(\"Oops!\\nThat was no valid number.\\nTry again...\")\\n...\\nThe try statement works as follows.\\n• First, the try clause (the statement(s) between the try and except keywords) is executed.\\n• If no exception occurs, the except clause is skipped and execution of the try statement is ﬁnished.\\n• If an exception occurs during execution of the try clause, the rest of the clause is skipped. Then if its\\ntype matches the exception named after the except keyword, the except clause is executed, and then\\nexecution continues after the try statement.\\n• If an exception occurs which does not match the exception named in the except clause, it is passed on\\nto outer try statements; if no handler is found, it is an unhandled exception and execution stops with\\na message as shown above.\\nA try statement may have more than one except clause, to specify handlers for diﬀerent exceptions. At\\nmost one handler will be executed. Handlers only handle exceptions that occur in the corresponding try\\nclause, not in other handlers of the same try statement. An except clause may name multiple exceptions as\\na parenthesized tuple, for example:\\n... except (RuntimeError, TypeError, NameError):\\n...\\npass\\nA class in an except clause is compatible with an exception if it is the same class or a base class thereof (but\\nnot the other way around — an except clause listing a derived class is not compatible with a base class).\\nFor example, the following code will print B, C, D in that order:\\nclass B(Exception):\\npass\\n(continues on next page)\\n62\\nChapter 8.\\nErrors and Exceptions'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 68}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\nclass C(B):\\npass\\nclass D(C):\\npass\\nfor cls in [B, C, D]:\\ntry:\\nraise cls()\\nexcept D:\\nprint(\"D\")\\nexcept C:\\nprint(\"C\")\\nexcept B:\\nprint(\"B\")\\nNote that if the except clauses were reversed (with except B ﬁrst), it would have printed B, B, B — the\\nﬁrst matching except clause is triggered.\\nThe last except clause may omit the exception name(s), to serve as a wildcard.

For example:\\nfor arg in sys.argv[1:]:\\ntry:\\nf = open(arg, \\'r\\')\\nexcept OSError:\\nprint(\\'cannot open\\', arg)\\nelse:\\nprint(arg, \\'has\\', len(f.readlines()), \\'lines\\')\\nf.close()\\nThe use of the else clause is better than adding additional code to the try clause because it avoids acciden-\\ntally catching an exception that wasn’t raised by the code being protected by the try … except statement.\\nWhen an exception occurs, it may have an associated value, also known as the exception’s argument. The\\npresence and type of the argument depend on the exception type.\\nThe except clause may specify a variable after the exception name.

When creating a module that can raise several distinct errors, a common practice is to create\\na base class for exceptions deﬁned by that module, and subclass that to create speciﬁc exception classes for\\ndiﬀerent error conditions:\\nclass Error(Exception):\\n\"\"\"Base class for exceptions in this module.\"\"\"\\npass\\nclass InputError(Error):\\n\"\"\"Exception raised for errors in the input.\\nAttributes:\\nexpression -- input expression in which the error occurred\\nmessage -- explanation of the error\\n\"\"\"\\ndef __init__(self, expression, message):\\nself.expression = expression\\nself.message = message\\nclass TransitionError(Error):\\n\"\"\"Raised when an operation attempts a state transition that\\'s not\\nallowed.\\nAttributes:\\nprevious -- state at beginning of transition\\nnext -- attempted new state\\nmessage -- explanation of why the specific transition is not allowed\\n\"\"\"\\ndef __init__(self, previous, next, message):\\nself.previous = previous\\nself.next = next\\nself.message = message\\nMost exceptions are deﬁned with names that end in “Error,” similar to the naming of the standard exceptions.\\nMany standard modules deﬁne their own exceptions to report errors that may occur in functions they deﬁne.\\nMore information on classes is presented in chapter Classes.\\n8.5.\\nUser-deﬁned Exceptions\\n65'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 71}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n8.6 Deﬁning Clean-up Actions\\nThe try statement has another optional clause which is intended to deﬁne clean-up actions that must be\\nexecuted under all circumstances.

Creating a new class creates a new type\\nof object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached\\nto it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (deﬁned by its class) for modifying its\\nstate.\\nCompared with other programming languages, Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of\\nnew syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. Python\\nclasses provide all the standard features of Object Oriented Programming: the class inheritance mechanism\\nallows multiple base classes, a derived class can override any methods of its base class or classes, and a\\nmethod can call the method of a base class with the same name. Objects can contain arbitrary amounts and\\nkinds of data. As is true for modules, classes partake of the dynamic nature of Python: they are created at\\nruntime, and can be modiﬁed further after creation.\\nIn C++ terminology, normally class members (including the data members) are public (except see below\\nPrivate Variables), and all member functions are virtual.\\nAs in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for\\nreferencing the object’s members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit ﬁrst\\nargument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call. As in Smalltalk, classes themselves\\nare objects. This provides semantics for importing and renaming. Unlike C++ and Modula-3, built-in types\\ncan be used as base classes for extension by the user. Also, like in C++, most built-in operators with special\\nsyntax (arithmetic operators, subscripting etc.) can be redeﬁned for class instances.\\n(Lacking universally accepted terminology to talk about classes, I will make occasional use of Smalltalk and\\nC++ terms. I would use Modula-3 terms, since its object-oriented semantics are closer to those of Python\\nthan C++, but I expect that few readers have heard of it.)\\n9.1 A Word About Names and Objects\\nObjects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can be bound to the same object. This\\nis known as aliasing in other languages. This is usually not appreciated on a ﬁrst glance at Python, and\\ncan be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types (numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing\\nhas a possibly surprising eﬀect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as lists,\\ndictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the beneﬁt of the program, since aliases behave\\nlike pointers in some respects. For example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer is passed by the\\nimplementation; and if a function modiﬁes an object passed as an argument, the caller will see the change\\n— this eliminates the need for two diﬀerent argument passing mechanisms as in Pascal.\\n9.2 Python Scopes and Namespaces\\nBefore introducing classes, I ﬁrst have to tell you something about Python’s scope rules.

Incidentally, knowledge about this subject is useful for any advanced Python\\nprogrammer.\\nLet’s begin with some deﬁnitions.\\nA namespace is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are currently implemented as Python\\ndictionaries, but that’s normally not noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change\\nin the future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names (containing functions such as abs(),\\nand built-in exception names); the global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation.\\nIn a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The important thing to know about\\nnamespaces is that there is absolutely no relation between names in diﬀerent namespaces; for instance, two\\ndiﬀerent modules may both deﬁne a function maximize without confusion — users of the modules must\\npreﬁx it with the module name.\\nBy the way, I use the word attribute for any name following a dot — for example, in the expression z.\\nreal, real is an attribute of the object z. Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are attribute\\nreferences: in the expression modname.funcname, modname is a module object and funcname is an attribute\\nof it. In this case there happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module’s attributes and the\\nglobal names deﬁned in the module: they share the same namespace!1\\nAttributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment to attributes is possible. Module\\nattributes are writable: you can write modname.the_answer = 42. Writable attributes may also be deleted\\nwith the del statement. For example, del modname.the_answer will remove the attribute the_answer from\\nthe object named by modname.\\nNamespaces are created at diﬀerent moments and have diﬀerent lifetimes. The namespace containing the\\nbuilt-in names is created when the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global namespace\\nfor a module is created when the module deﬁnition is read in; normally, module namespaces also last until\\nthe interpreter quits. The statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter, either read\\nfrom a script ﬁle or interactively, are considered part of a module called __main__, so they have their own\\nglobal namespace. (The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is called builtins.)\\nThe local namespace for a function is created when the function is called, and deleted when the function\\nreturns or raises an exception that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be a\\nbetter way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, recursive invocations each have their own local\\nnamespace.\\nA scope is a textual region of a Python program where a namespace is directly accessible. “Directly accessible”\\nhere means that an unqualiﬁed reference to a name attempts to ﬁnd the name in the namespace.\\nAlthough scopes are determined statically, they are used dynamically. At any time during execution, there\\nare at least three nested scopes whose namespaces are directly accessible:\\n• the innermost scope, which is searched ﬁrst, contains the local names\\n• the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope,\\ncontains non-local, but also non-global names\\n• the next-to-last scope contains the current module’s global names\\n• the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names\\nIf a name is declared global, then all references and assignments go directly to the middle scope containing the\\nmodule’s global names. To rebind variables found outside of the innermost scope, the nonlocal statement\\ncan be used; if not declared nonlocal, those variables are read-only (an attempt to write to such a variable\\nwill simply create a new local variable in the innermost scope, leaving the identically named outer variable\\nunchanged).\\n1 Except for one thing. Module objects have a secret read-only attribute called __dict__ which returns the dictionary used\\nto implement the module’s namespace; the name __dict__ is an attribute but not a global name. Obviously, using this violates\\nthe abstraction of namespace implementation, and should be restricted to things like post-mortem debuggers.\\n70\\nChapter 9.\\nClasses'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 76}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nUsually, the local scope references the local names of the (textually) current function. Outside functions, the\\nlocal scope references the same namespace as the global scope: the module’s namespace. Class deﬁnitions\\nplace yet another namespace in the local scope.\\nIt is important to realize that scopes are determined textually: the global scope of a function deﬁned in a\\nmodule is that module’s namespace, no matter from where or by what alias the function is called. On the\\nother hand, the actual search for names is done dynamically, at run time — however, the language deﬁnition\\nis evolving towards static name resolution, at “compile” time, so don’t rely on dynamic name resolution! (In\\nfact, local variables are already determined statically.)\\nA special quirk of Python is that – if no global statement is in eﬀect – assignments to names always go into\\nthe innermost scope. Assignments do not copy data — they just bind names to objects. The same is true for\\ndeletions: the statement del x removes the binding of x from the namespace referenced by the local scope.\\nIn fact, all operations that introduce new names use the local scope: in particular, import statements and\\nfunction deﬁnitions bind the module or function name in the local scope.\\nThe global statement can be used to indicate that particular variables live in the global scope and should\\nbe rebound there; the nonlocal statement indicates that particular variables live in an enclosing scope and\\nshould be rebound there.\\n9.2.1 Scopes and Namespaces Example\\nThis is an example demonstrating how to reference the diﬀerent scopes and namespaces, and how global\\nand nonlocal aﬀect variable binding:\\ndef scope_test():\\ndef do_local():\\nspam = \"local spam\"\\ndef do_nonlocal():\\nnonlocal spam\\nspam = \"nonlocal spam\"\\ndef do_global():\\nglobal spam\\nspam = \"global spam\"\\nspam = \"test spam\"\\ndo_local()\\nprint(\"After local assignment:\", spam)\\ndo_nonlocal()\\nprint(\"After nonlocal assignment:\", spam)\\ndo_global()\\nprint(\"After global assignment:\", spam)\\nscope_test()\\nprint(\"In global scope:\", spam)\\nThe output of the example code is:\\nAfter local assignment: test spam\\nAfter nonlocal assignment: nonlocal spam\\nAfter global assignment: nonlocal spam\\nIn global scope: global spam\\nNote how the local assignment (which is default) didn’t change scope_test’s binding of spam.

The function deﬁnitions inside a class\\nnormally have a peculiar form of argument list, dictated by the calling conventions for methods — again,\\nthis is explained later.\\nWhen a class deﬁnition is entered, a new namespace is created, and used as the local scope — thus, all\\nassignments to local variables go into this new namespace. In particular, function deﬁnitions bind the name\\nof the new function here.\\nWhen a class deﬁnition is left normally (via the end), a class object is created. This is basically a wrapper\\naround the contents of the namespace created by the class deﬁnition; we’ll learn more about class objects\\nin the next section. The original local scope (the one in eﬀect just before the class deﬁnition was entered)\\nis reinstated, and the class object is bound here to the class name given in the class deﬁnition header\\n(ClassName in the example).\\n9.3.2 Class Objects\\nClass objects support two kinds of operations: attribute references and instantiation.\\nAttribute references use the standard syntax used for all attribute references in Python: obj.name. Valid\\nattribute names are all the names that were in the class’s namespace when the class object was created. So,\\nif the class deﬁnition looked like this:\\nclass MyClass:\\n\"\"\"A simple example class\"\"\"\\ni = 12345\\ndef f(self):\\nreturn \\'hello world\\'\\nthen MyClass.i and MyClass.f are valid attribute references, returning an integer and a function object,\\nrespectively. Class attributes can also be assigned to, so you can change the value of MyClass.i by assign-\\nment. __doc__ is also a valid attribute, returning the docstring belonging to the class: \"A simple example\\nclass\".\\n72\\nChapter 9.\\nClasses'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 78}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nClass instantiation uses function notation. Just pretend that the class object is a parameterless function\\nthat returns a new instance of the class. For example (assuming the above class):\\nx = MyClass()\\ncreates a new instance of the class and assigns this object to the local variable x.\\nThe instantiation operation (“calling” a class object) creates an empty object. Many classes like to create\\nobjects with instances customized to a speciﬁc initial state. Therefore a class may deﬁne a special method\\nnamed __init__(), like this:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.data = []\\nWhen a class deﬁnes an __init__() method, class instantiation automatically invokes __init__() for the\\nnewly-created class instance. So in this example, a new, initialized instance can be obtained by:\\nx = MyClass()\\nOf course, the __init__() method may have arguments for greater ﬂexibility. In that case, arguments given\\nto the class instantiation operator are passed on to __init__(). For example,\\n>>> class Complex:\\n...\\ndef __init__(self, realpart, imagpart):\\n...\\nself.r = realpart\\n...\\nself.i = imagpart\\n...\\n>>> x = Complex(3.0, -4.5)\\n>>> x.r, x.i\\n(3.0, -4.5)\\n9.3.3 Instance Objects\\nNow what can we do with instance objects? The only operations understood by instance objects are attribute\\nreferences. There are two kinds of valid attribute names, data attributes and methods.\\ndata attributes correspond to “instance variables” in Smalltalk, and to “data members” in C++.\\nData\\nattributes need not be declared; like local variables, they spring into existence when they are ﬁrst assigned\\nto. For example, if x is the instance of MyClass created above, the following piece of code will print the\\nvalue 16, without leaving a trace:\\nx.counter = 1\\nwhile x.counter < 10:\\nx.counter = x.counter * 2\\nprint(x.counter)\\ndel x.counter\\nThe other kind of instance attribute reference is a method. A method is a function that “belongs to” an\\nobject. (In Python, the term method is not unique to class instances: other object types can have methods\\nas well. For example, list objects have methods called append, insert, remove, sort, and so on. However, in\\nthe following discussion, we’ll use the term method exclusively to mean methods of class instance objects,\\nunless explicitly stated otherwise.)\\nValid method names of an instance object depend on its class. By deﬁnition, all attributes of a class that\\nare function objects deﬁne corresponding methods of its instances. So in our example, x.f is a valid method\\nreference, since MyClass.f is a function, but x.i is not, since MyClass.i is not. But x.f is not the same\\nthing as MyClass.f — it is a method object, not a function object.\\n9.3.\\nA First Look at Classes\\n73'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 79}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n9.3.4 Method Objects\\nUsually, a method is called right after it is bound:\\nx.f()\\nIn the MyClass example, this will return the string 'hello world'. However, it is not necessary to call a\\nmethod right away: x.f is a method object, and can be stored away and called at a later time. For example:\\nxf = x.f\\nwhile True:\\nprint(xf())\\nwill continue to print hello world until the end of time.\\nWhat exactly happens when a method is called? You may have noticed that x.f() was called without an\\nargument above, even though the function deﬁnition for f() speciﬁed an argument. What happened to the\\nargument? Surely Python raises an exception when a function that requires an argument is called without\\nany — even if the argument isn’t actually used…\\nActually, you may have guessed the answer: the special thing about methods is that the instance object is\\npassed as the ﬁrst argument of the function. In our example, the call x.f() is exactly equivalent to MyClass.\\nf(x). In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding\\nfunction with an argument list that is created by inserting the method’s instance object before the ﬁrst\\nargument.\\nIf you still don’t understand how methods work, a look at the implementation can perhaps clarify matters.\\nWhen a non-data attribute of an instance is referenced, the instance’s class is searched. If the name denotes\\na valid class attribute that is a function object, a method object is created by packing (pointers to) the\\ninstance object and the function object just found together in an abstract object: this is the method object.\\nWhen the method object is called with an argument list, a new argument list is constructed from the instance\\nobject and the argument list, and the function object is called with this new argument list.\\n9.3.5 Class and Instance Variables\\nGenerally speaking, instance variables are for data unique to each instance and class variables are for at-\\ntributes and methods shared by all instances of the class:\\nclass Dog:\\nkind = 'canine'\\n# class variable shared by all instances\\ndef __init__(self, name):\\nself.name = name\\n# instance variable unique to each instance\\n>>> d = Dog('Fido')\\n>>> e = Dog('Buddy')\\n>>> d.kind\\n# shared by all dogs\\n'canine'\\n>>> e.kind\\n# shared by all dogs\\n'canine'\\n>>> d.name\\n# unique to d\\n'Fido'\\n>>> e.name\\n# unique to e\\n'Buddy'\\n74\\nChapter 9.\\nClasses\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 80}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nAs discussed in A Word About Names and Objects, shared data can have possibly surprising eﬀects with\\ninvolving mutable objects such as lists and dictionaries.

Possible conventions include capitalizing method names, preﬁxing data attribute names\\nwith a small unique string (perhaps just an underscore), or using verbs for methods and nouns for data\\nattributes.\\nData attributes may be referenced by methods as well as by ordinary users (“clients”) of an object. In\\nother words, classes are not usable to implement pure abstract data types.\\nIn fact, nothing in Python\\nmakes it possible to enforce data hiding — it is all based upon convention. (On the other hand, the Python\\nimplementation, written in C, can completely hide implementation details and control access to an object if\\nnecessary; this can be used by extensions to Python written in C.)\\nClients should use data attributes with care — clients may mess up invariants maintained by the methods\\n9.4.\\nRandom Remarks\\n75\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 81}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nby stamping on their data attributes. Note that clients may add data attributes of their own to an instance\\nobject without aﬀecting the validity of the methods, as long as name conﬂicts are avoided — again, a naming\\nconvention can save a lot of headaches here.\\nThere is no shorthand for referencing data attributes (or other methods!) from within methods. I ﬁnd that\\nthis actually increases the readability of methods: there is no chance of confusing local variables and instance\\nvariables when glancing through a method.\\nOften, the ﬁrst argument of a method is called self. This is nothing more than a convention: the name\\nself has absolutely no special meaning to Python. Note, however, that by not following the convention\\nyour code may be less readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that a class browser\\nprogram might be written that relies upon such a convention.\\nAny function object that is a class attribute deﬁnes a method for instances of that class. It is not necessary\\nthat the function deﬁnition is textually enclosed in the class deﬁnition: assigning a function object to a local\\nvariable in the class is also ok. For example:\\n# Function defined outside the class\\ndef f1(self, x, y):\\nreturn min(x, x+y)\\nclass C:\\nf = f1\\ndef g(self):\\nreturn 'hello world'\\nh = g\\nNow f, g and h are all attributes of class C that refer to function objects, and consequently they are all\\nmethods of instances of C — h being exactly equivalent to g. Note that this practice usually only serves to\\nconfuse the reader of a program.\\nMethods may call other methods by using method attributes of the self argument:\\nclass Bag:\\ndef __init__(self):\\nself.data = []\\ndef add(self, x):\\nself.data.append(x)\\ndef addtwice(self, x):\\nself.add(x)\\nself.add(x)\\nMethods may reference global names in the same way as ordinary functions. The global scope associated\\nwith a method is the module containing its deﬁnition. (A class is never used as a global scope.) While one\\nrarely encounters a good reason for using global data in a method, there are many legitimate uses of the\\nglobal scope: for one thing, functions and modules imported into the global scope can be used by methods,\\nas well as functions and classes deﬁned in it. Usually, the class containing the method is itself deﬁned in this\\nglobal scope, and in the next section we’ll ﬁnd some good reasons why a method would want to reference its\\nown class.\\nEach value is an object, and therefore has a class (also called its type). It is stored as object.__class__.\\n76\\nChapter 9.\\nClasses\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 82}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n9.5 Inheritance\\nOf course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name “class” without supporting inheritance. The\\nsyntax for a derived class deﬁnition looks like this:\\nclass DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):\\n<statement-1>\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n<statement-N>\\nThe name BaseClassName must be deﬁned in a scope containing the derived class deﬁnition. In place of\\na base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. This can be useful, for example, when the\\nbase class is deﬁned in another module:\\nclass DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):\\nExecution of a derived class deﬁnition proceeds the same as for a base class.\\nWhen the class object is\\nconstructed, the base class is remembered. This is used for resolving attribute references: if a requested\\nattribute is not found in the class, the search proceeds to look in the base class.\\nThis rule is applied\\nrecursively if the base class itself is derived from some other class.\\nThere’s nothing special about instantiation of derived classes: DerivedClassName() creates a new instance of\\nthe class. Method references are resolved as follows: the corresponding class attribute is searched, descending\\ndown the chain of base classes if necessary, and the method reference is valid if this yields a function object.\\nDerived classes may override methods of their base classes. Because methods have no special privileges when\\ncalling other methods of the same object, a method of a base class that calls another method deﬁned in the\\nsame base class may end up calling a method of a derived class that overrides it. (For C++ programmers:\\nall methods in Python are eﬀectively virtual.)\\nAn overriding method in a derived class may in fact want to extend rather than simply replace the base\\nclass method of the same name. There is a simple way to call the base class method directly: just call\\nBaseClassName.methodname(self, arguments). This is occasionally useful to clients as well. (Note that\\nthis only works if the base class is accessible as BaseClassName in the global scope.)\\nPython has two built-in functions that work with inheritance:\\n• Use isinstance() to check an instance’s type: isinstance(obj, int) will be True only if obj.\\n__class__ is int or some class derived from int.\\n• Use issubclass() to check class inheritance: issubclass(bool, int) is True since bool is a subclass\\nof int. However, issubclass(float, int) is False since float is not a subclass of int.\\n9.5.1 Multiple Inheritance\\nPython supports a form of multiple inheritance as well. A class deﬁnition with multiple base classes looks\\nlike this:\\nclass DerivedClassName(Base1, Base2, Base3):\\n<statement-1>\\n.\\n.\\n.\\n<statement-N>\\n9.5.\\nInheritance\\n77'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 83}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nFor most purposes, in the simplest cases, you can think of the search for attributes inherited from a parent\\nclass as depth-ﬁrst, left-to-right, not searching twice in the same class where there is an overlap in the hier-\\narchy. Thus, if an attribute is not found in DerivedClassName, it is searched for in Base1, then (recursively)\\nin the base classes of Base1, and if it was not found there, it was searched for in Base2, and so on.\\nIn fact, it is slightly more complex than that; the method resolution order changes dynamically to support\\ncooperative calls to super().\\nThis approach is known in some other multiple-inheritance languages as\\ncall-next-method and is more powerful than the super call found in single-inheritance languages.\\nDynamic ordering is necessary because all cases of multiple inheritance exhibit one or more diamond re-\\nlationships (where at least one of the parent classes can be accessed through multiple paths from the\\nbottommost class).\\nFor example, all classes inherit from object, so any case of multiple inheritance\\nprovides more than one path to reach object. To keep the base classes from being accessed more than\\nonce, the dynamic algorithm linearizes the search order in a way that preserves the left-to-right order-\\ning speciﬁed in each class, that calls each parent only once, and that is monotonic (meaning that a class\\ncan be subclassed without aﬀecting the precedence order of its parents). Taken together, these properties\\nmake it possible to design reliable and extensible classes with multiple inheritance. For more detail, see\\nhttps://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/.\\n9.6 Private Variables\\n“Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python.\\nHowever, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name preﬁxed with an underscore\\n(e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data\\nmember). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.\\nSince there is a valid use-case for class-private members (namely to avoid name clashes of names with names\\ndeﬁned by subclasses), there is limited support for such a mechanism, called name mangling. Any identiﬁer\\nof the form __spam (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced\\nwith _classname__spam, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped.\\nThis mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identiﬁer, as long as it occurs within\\nthe deﬁnition of a class.\\nName mangling is helpful for letting subclasses override methods without breaking intraclass method calls.\\nFor example:\\nclass Mapping:\\ndef __init__(self, iterable):\\nself.items_list = []\\nself.__update(iterable)\\ndef update(self, iterable):\\nfor item in iterable:\\nself.items_list.append(item)\\n__update = update\\n# private copy of original update() method\\nclass MappingSubclass(Mapping):\\ndef update(self, keys, values):\\n# provides new signature for update()\\n# but does not break __init__()\\nfor item in zip(keys, values):\\nself.items_list.append(item)\\nNote that the mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents; it still is possible to access or modify a\\nvariable that is considered private. This can even be useful in special circumstances, such as in the debugger.\\n78\\nChapter 9.\\nClasses'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 84}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nNotice that code passed to exec() or eval() does not consider the classname of the invoking class to be the\\ncurrent class; this is similar to the eﬀect of the global statement, the eﬀect of which is likewise restricted to\\ncode that is byte-compiled together. The same restriction applies to getattr(), setattr() and delattr(),\\nas well as when referencing __dict__ directly.\\n9.7 Odds and Ends\\nSometimes it is useful to have a data type similar to the Pascal “record” or C “struct”, bundling together a\\nfew named data items. An empty class deﬁnition will do nicely:\\nclass Employee:\\npass\\njohn = Employee()\\n# Create an empty employee record\\n# Fill the fields of the record\\njohn.name = \\'John Doe\\'\\njohn.dept = \\'computer lab\\'\\njohn.salary = 1000\\nA piece of Python code that expects a particular abstract data type can often be passed a class that emulates\\nthe methods of that data type instead. For instance, if you have a function that formats some data from\\na ﬁle object, you can deﬁne a class with methods read() and readline() that get the data from a string\\nbuﬀer instead, and pass it as an argument.\\nInstance method objects have attributes, too: m.__self__ is the instance object with the method m(), and\\nm.__func__ is the function object corresponding to the method.\\n9.8 Iterators\\nBy now you have probably noticed that most container objects can be looped over using a for statement:\\nfor element in [1, 2, 3]:\\nprint(element)\\nfor element in (1, 2, 3):\\nprint(element)\\nfor key in {\\'one\\':1, \\'two\\':2}:\\nprint(key)\\nfor char in \"123\":\\nprint(char)\\nfor line in open(\"myfile.txt\"):\\nprint(line, end=\\'\\')\\nThis style of access is clear, concise, and convenient. The use of iterators pervades and uniﬁes Python.\\nBehind the scenes, the for statement calls iter() on the container object. The function returns an iterator\\nobject that deﬁnes the method __next__() which accesses elements in the container one at a time. When\\nthere are no more elements, __next__() raises a StopIteration exception which tells the for loop to\\nterminate. You can call the __next__() method using the next() built-in function; this example shows how\\nit all works:\\n>>> s = \\'abc\\'\\n>>> it = iter(s)\\n>>> it\\n(continues on next page)\\n9.7.\\nOdds and Ends\\n79'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 85}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\n<iterator object at 0x00A1DB50>\\n>>> next(it)\\n\\'a\\'\\n>>> next(it)\\n\\'b\\'\\n>>> next(it)\\n\\'c\\'\\n>>> next(it)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nnext(it)\\nStopIteration\\nHaving seen the mechanics behind the iterator protocol, it is easy to add iterator behavior to your classes.\\nDeﬁne an __iter__() method which returns an object with a __next__() method.

For complex matching and\\nmanipulation, regular expressions oﬀer succinct, optimized solutions:\\n>>> import re\\n>>> re.findall(r'\\\\bf[a-z]*', 'which foot or hand fell fastest')\\n['foot', 'fell', 'fastest']\\n>>> re.sub(r'(\\\\b[a-z]+) \\\\1', r'\\\\1', 'cat in the the hat')\\n'cat in the hat'\\nWhen only simple capabilities are needed, string methods are preferred because they are easier to read and\\ndebug:\\n>>> 'tea for too'.replace('too', 'two')\\n'tea for two'\\n10.6 Mathematics\\nThe math module gives access to the underlying C library functions for ﬂoating point math:\\n>>> import math\\n>>> math.cos(math.pi / 4)\\n0.70710678118654757\\n>>> math.log(1024, 2)\\n10.0\\nThe random module provides tools for making random selections:\\n84\\nChapter 10.\\nBrief Tour of the Standard Library\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 90}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n>>> import random\\n>>> random.choice([\\'apple\\', \\'pear\\', \\'banana\\'])\\n\\'apple\\'\\n>>> random.sample(range(100), 10)\\n# sampling without replacement\\n[30, 83, 16, 4, 8, 81, 41, 50, 18, 33]\\n>>> random.random()\\n# random float\\n0.17970987693706186\\n>>> random.randrange(6)\\n# random integer chosen from range(6)\\n4\\nThe statistics module calculates basic statistical properties (the mean, median, variance, etc.) of numeric\\ndata:\\n>>> import statistics\\n>>> data = [2.75, 1.75, 1.25, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 3.5]\\n>>> statistics.mean(data)\\n1.6071428571428572\\n>>> statistics.median(data)\\n1.25\\n>>> statistics.variance(data)\\n1.3720238095238095\\nThe SciPy project <https://scipy.org> has many other modules for numerical computations.\\n10.7 Internet Access\\nThere are a number of modules for accessing the internet and processing internet protocols.

Python provides a measurement tool that answers those questions immediately.\\nFor example, it may be tempting to use the tuple packing and unpacking feature instead of the tradi-\\ntional approach to swapping arguments. The timeit module quickly demonstrates a modest performance\\nadvantage:\\n>>> from timeit import Timer\\n>>> Timer(\\'t=a; a=b; b=t\\', \\'a=1; b=2\\').timeit()\\n0.57535828626024577\\n>>> Timer(\\'a,b = b,a\\', \\'a=1; b=2\\').timeit()\\n0.54962537085770791\\nIn contrast to timeit’s ﬁne level of granularity, the profile and pstats modules provide tools for identifying\\ntime critical sections in larger blocks of code.\\n86\\nChapter 10.\\nBrief Tour of the Standard Library'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 92}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n10.11 Quality Control\\nOne approach for developing high quality software is to write tests for each function as it is developed and\\nto run those tests frequently during the development process.\\nThe doctest module provides a tool for scanning a module and validating tests embedded in a program’s\\ndocstrings. Test construction is as simple as cutting-and-pasting a typical call along with its results into\\nthe docstring. This improves the documentation by providing the user with an example and it allows the\\ndoctest module to make sure the code remains true to the documentation:\\ndef average(values):\\n\"\"\"Computes the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers.\\n>>> print(average([20, 30, 70]))\\n40.0\\n\"\"\"\\nreturn sum(values) / len(values)\\nimport doctest\\ndoctest.testmod()\\n# automatically validate the embedded tests\\nThe unittest module is not as eﬀortless as the doctest module, but it allows a more comprehensive set of\\ntests to be maintained in a separate ﬁle:\\nimport unittest\\nclass TestStatisticalFunctions(unittest.TestCase):\\ndef test_average(self):\\nself.assertEqual(average([20, 30, 70]), 40.0)\\nself.assertEqual(round(average([1, 5, 7]), 1), 4.3)\\nwith self.assertRaises(ZeroDivisionError):\\naverage([])\\nwith self.assertRaises(TypeError):\\naverage(20, 30, 70)\\nunittest.main()\\n# Calling from the command line invokes all tests\\n10.12 Batteries Included\\nPython has a “batteries included” philosophy.\\nThis is best seen through the sophisticated and robust\\ncapabilities of its larger packages. For example:\\n• The xmlrpc.client and xmlrpc.server modules make implementing remote procedure calls into an\\nalmost trivial task. Despite the modules names, no direct knowledge or handling of XML is needed.\\n• The email package is a library for managing email messages, including MIME and other RFC 2822-\\nbased message documents. Unlike smtplib and poplib which actually send and receive messages, the\\nemail package has a complete toolset for building or decoding complex message structures (including\\nattachments) and for implementing internet encoding and header protocols.\\n• The json package provides robust support for parsing this popular data interchange format. The csv\\nmodule supports direct reading and writing of ﬁles in Comma-Separated Value format, commonly sup-\\nported by databases and spreadsheets. XML processing is supported by the xml.etree.ElementTree,\\nxml.dom and xml.sax packages. Together, these modules and packages greatly simplify data inter-\\nchange between Python applications and other tools.\\n10.11.\\nQuality Control\\n87'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 93}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n• The sqlite3 module is a wrapper for the SQLite database library, providing a persistent database\\nthat can be updated and accessed using slightly nonstandard SQL syntax.\\n• Internationalization is supported by a number of modules including gettext, locale, and the codecs\\npackage.\\n88\\nChapter 10.\\nBrief Tour of the Standard Library'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 94}, page_content='CHAPTER\\nELEVEN\\nBRIEF TOUR OF THE STANDARD LIBRARY — PART II\\nThis second tour covers more advanced modules that support professional programming needs.

This allows users to customize their applications without having to alter the application.\\nThe format uses placeholder names formed by $ with valid Python identiﬁers (alphanumeric characters and\\nunderscores). Surrounding the placeholder with braces allows it to be followed by more alphanumeric letters\\nwith no intervening spaces. Writing $$ creates a single escaped $:\\n>>> from string import Template\\n>>> t = Template(\\'${village}folk send $$10 to $cause.\\')\\n>>> t.substitute(village=\\'Nottingham\\', cause=\\'the ditch fund\\')\\n\\'Nottinghamfolk send $10 to the ditch fund.\\'\\nThe substitute() method raises a KeyError when a placeholder is not supplied in a dictionary or a\\nkeyword argument.\\nFor mail-merge style applications, user supplied data may be incomplete and the\\nsafe_substitute() method may be more appropriate — it will leave placeholders unchanged if data is\\nmissing:\\n>>> t = Template(\\'Return the $item to $owner.\\')\\n>>> d = dict(item=\\'unladen swallow\\')\\n>>> t.substitute(d)\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n...\\nKeyError: \\'owner\\'\\n>>> t.safe_substitute(d)\\n\\'Return the unladen swallow to $owner.\\'\\nTemplate subclasses can specify a custom delimiter. For example, a batch renaming utility for a photo\\nbrowser may elect to use percent signs for placeholders such as the current date, image sequence number, or\\nﬁle format:\\n>>> import time, os.path\\n>>> photofiles = [\\'img_1074.jpg\\', \\'img_1076.jpg\\', \\'img_1077.jpg\\']\\n>>> class BatchRename(Template):\\n...\\ndelimiter = \\'%\\'\\n>>> fmt = input(\\'Enter rename style (%d-date %n-seqnum %f-format):\\n\\')\\nEnter rename style (%d-date %n-seqnum %f-format):\\nAshley_%n%f\\n>>> t = BatchRename(fmt)\\n>>> date = time.strftime(\\'%d%b%y\\')\\n>>> for i, filename in enumerate(photofiles):\\n...\\nbase, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)\\n...\\nnewname = t.substitute(d=date, n=i, f=ext)\\n(continues on next page)\\n90\\nChapter 11.\\nBrief Tour of the Standard Library — Part II'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 96}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\n...\\nprint(\\'{0} --> {1}\\'.format(filename, newname))\\nimg_1074.jpg --> Ashley_0.jpg\\nimg_1076.jpg --> Ashley_1.jpg\\nimg_1077.jpg --> Ashley_2.jpg\\nAnother application for templating is separating program logic from the details of multiple output formats.\\nThis makes it possible to substitute custom templates for XML ﬁles, plain text reports, and HTML web\\nreports.\\n11.3 Working with Binary Data Record Layouts\\nThe struct module provides pack() and unpack() functions for working with variable length binary record\\nformats. The following example shows how to loop through header information in a ZIP ﬁle without using\\nthe zipfile module. Pack codes \"H\" and \"I\" represent two and four byte unsigned numbers respectively.\\nThe \"<\" indicates that they are standard size and in little-endian byte order:\\nimport struct\\nwith open(\\'myfile.zip\\', \\'rb\\') as f:\\ndata = f.read()\\nstart = 0\\nfor i in range(3):\\n# show the first 3 file headers\\nstart += 14\\nfields = struct.unpack(\\'<IIIHH\\', data[start:start+16])\\ncrc32, comp_size, uncomp_size, filenamesize, extra_size = fields\\nstart += 16\\nfilename = data[start:start+filenamesize]\\nstart += filenamesize\\nextra = data[start:start+extra_size]\\nprint(filename, hex(crc32), comp_size, uncomp_size)\\nstart += extra_size + comp_size\\n# skip to the next header\\n11.4 Multi-threading\\nThreading is a technique for decoupling tasks which are not sequentially dependent. Threads can be used to\\nimprove the responsiveness of applications that accept user input while other tasks run in the background.\\nA related use case is running I/O in parallel with computations in another thread.\\nThe following code shows how the high level threading module can run tasks in background while the main\\nprogram continues to run:\\nimport threading, zipfile\\nclass AsyncZip(threading.Thread):\\ndef __init__(self, infile, outfile):\\nthreading.Thread.__init__(self)\\nself.infile = infile\\nself.outfile = outfile\\n(continues on next page)\\n11.3.\\nWorking with Binary Data Record Layouts\\n91'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 97}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(continued from previous page)\\ndef run(self):\\nf = zipfile.ZipFile(self.outfile, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)\\nf.write(self.infile)\\nf.close()\\nprint('Finished background zip of:', self.infile)\\nbackground = AsyncZip('mydata.txt', 'myarchive.zip')\\nbackground.start()\\nprint('The main program continues to run in foreground.')\\nbackground.join()\\n# Wait for the background task to finish\\nprint('Main program waited until background was done.')\\nThe principal challenge of multi-threaded applications is coordinating threads that share data or other\\nresources. To that end, the threading module provides a number of synchronization primitives including\\nlocks, events, condition variables, and semaphores.\\nWhile those tools are powerful, minor design errors can result in problems that are diﬃcult to reproduce.\\nSo, the preferred approach to task coordination is to concentrate all access to a resource in a single thread\\nand then use the queue module to feed that thread with requests from other threads. Applications using\\nQueue objects for inter-thread communication and coordination are easier to design, more readable, and\\nmore reliable.\\n11.5 Logging\\nThe logging module oﬀers a full featured and ﬂexible logging system. At its simplest, log messages are sent\\nto a ﬁle or to sys.stderr:\\nimport logging\\nlogging.debug('Debugging information')\\nlogging.info('Informational message')\\nlogging.warning('Warning:config file %s not found', 'server.conf')\\nlogging.error('Error occurred')\\nlogging.critical('Critical error -- shutting down')\\nThis produces the following output:\\nWARNING:root:Warning:config file server.conf not found\\nERROR:root:Error occurred\\nCRITICAL:root:Critical error -- shutting down\\nBy default, informational and debugging messages are suppressed and the output is sent to standard er-\\nror. Other output options include routing messages through email, datagrams, sockets, or to an HTTP\\nServer. New ﬁlters can select diﬀerent routing based on message priority: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and\\nCRITICAL.\\nThe logging system can be conﬁgured directly from Python or can be loaded from a user editable conﬁguration\\nﬁle for customized logging without altering the application.\\n92\\nChapter 11.\\nBrief Tour of the Standard Library — Part II\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 98}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n11.6 Weak References\\nPython does automatic memory management (reference counting for most objects and garbage collection to\\neliminate cycles). The memory is freed shortly after the last reference to it has been eliminated.\\nThis approach works ﬁne for most applications but occasionally there is a need to track objects only as long\\nas they are being used by something else. Unfortunately, just tracking them creates a reference that makes\\nthem permanent. The weakref module provides tools for tracking objects without creating a reference.\\nWhen the object is no longer needed, it is automatically removed from a weakref table and a callback is\\ntriggered for weakref objects. Typical applications include caching objects that are expensive to create:\\n>>> import weakref, gc\\n>>> class A:\\n...\\ndef __init__(self, value):\\n...\\nself.value = value\\n...\\ndef __repr__(self):\\n...\\nreturn str(self.value)\\n...\\n>>> a = A(10)\\n# create a reference\\n>>> d = weakref.WeakValueDictionary()\\n>>> d[\\'primary\\'] = a\\n# does not create a reference\\n>>> d[\\'primary\\']\\n# fetch the object if it is still alive\\n10\\n>>> del a\\n# remove the one reference\\n>>> gc.collect()\\n# run garbage collection right away\\n0\\n>>> d[\\'primary\\']\\n# entry was automatically removed\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\nFile \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\\nd[\\'primary\\']\\n# entry was automatically removed\\nFile \"C:/python37/lib/weakref.py\", line 46, in __getitem__\\no = self.data[key]()\\nKeyError: \\'primary\\'\\n11.7 Tools for Working with Lists\\nMany data structure needs can be met with the built-in list type. However, sometimes there is a need for\\nalternative implementations with diﬀerent performance trade-oﬀs.\\nThe array module provides an array() object that is like a list that stores only homogeneous data and stores\\nit more compactly. The following example shows an array of numbers stored as two byte unsigned binary\\nnumbers (typecode \"H\") rather than the usual 16 bytes per entry for regular lists of Python int objects:\\n>>> from array import array\\n>>> a = array(\\'H\\', [4000, 10, 700, 22222])\\n>>> sum(a)\\n26932\\n>>> a[1:3]\\narray(\\'H\\', [10, 700])\\nThe collections module provides a deque() object that is like a list with faster appends and pops from\\nthe left side but slower lookups in the middle.

To resolve the earlier example of conﬂicting\\nrequirements, application A can have its own virtual environment with version 1.0 installed while application\\nB has another virtual environment with version 2.0. If application B requires a library be upgraded to version\\n3.0, this will not aﬀect application A’s environment.\\n12.2 Creating Virtual Environments\\nThe module used to create and manage virtual environments is called venv. venv will usually install the\\nmost recent version of Python that you have available. If you have multiple versions of Python on your\\nsystem, you can select a speciﬁc Python version by running python3 or whichever version you want.\\nTo create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv\\nmodule as a script with the directory path:\\npython3 -m venv tutorial-env\\nThis will create the tutorial-env directory if it doesn’t exist, and also create directories inside it containing\\na copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting ﬁles.\\nOnce you’ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.\\nOn Windows, run:\\ntutorial-env\\\\Scripts\\\\activate.bat\\nOn Unix or MacOS, run:\\nsource tutorial-env/bin/activate\\n97'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 103}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n(This script is written for the bash shell.

This library has its own documentation which we\\nwon’t duplicate here.\\n14.1 Tab Completion and History Editing\\nCompletion of variable and module names is automatically enabled at interpreter startup so that the Tab\\nkey invokes the completion function; it looks at Python statement names, the current local variables, and\\nthe available module names.

The completion mechanism might use the interpreter’s symbol\\ntable. A command to check (or even suggest) matching parentheses, quotes, etc., would also be useful.\\nOne alternative enhanced interactive interpreter that has been around for quite some time is IPython, which\\nfeatures tab completion, object exploration and advanced history management.

For example,\\nthe decimal fraction\\n0.125\\nhas value 1/10 + 2/100 + 5/1000, and in the same way the binary fraction\\n0.001\\nhas value 0/2 + 0/4 + 1/8. These two fractions have identical values, the only real diﬀerence being that the\\nﬁrst is written in base 10 fractional notation, and the second in base 2.\\nUnfortunately, most decimal fractions cannot be represented exactly as binary fractions. A consequence is\\nthat, in general, the decimal ﬂoating-point numbers you enter are only approximated by the binary ﬂoating-\\npoint numbers actually stored in the machine.\\nThe problem is easier to understand at ﬁrst in base 10. Consider the fraction 1/3. You can approximate\\nthat as a base 10 fraction:\\n0.3\\nor, better,\\n0.33\\nor, better,\\n0.333\\nand so on. No matter how many digits you’re willing to write down, the result will never be exactly 1/3,\\nbut will be an increasingly better approximation of 1/3.\\nIn the same way, no matter how many base 2 digits you’re willing to use, the decimal value 0.1 cannot be\\nrepresented exactly as a base 2 fraction. In base 2, 1/10 is the inﬁnitely repeating fraction\\n0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011...\\nStop at any ﬁnite number of bits, and you get an approximation.\\nOn most machines today, ﬂoats are\\napproximated using a binary fraction with the numerator using the ﬁrst 53 bits starting with the most\\nsigniﬁcant bit and with the denominator as a power of two.

The problem with “0.1” is explained in\\nprecise detail below, in the “Representation Error” section. See The Perils of Floating Point for a more\\ncomplete account of other common surprises.\\nAs that says near the end, “there are no easy answers.” Still, don’t be unduly wary of ﬂoating-point! The\\nerrors in Python ﬂoat operations are inherited from the ﬂoating-point hardware, and on most machines are\\non the order of no more than 1 part in 2**53 per operation. That’s more than adequate for most tasks, but\\nyou do need to keep in mind that it’s not decimal arithmetic and that every ﬂoat operation can suﬀer a new\\nrounding error.\\nWhile pathological cases do exist, for most casual use of ﬂoating-point arithmetic you’ll see the result you\\nexpect in the end if you simply round the display of your ﬁnal results to the number of decimal digits you\\nexpect. str() usually suﬃces, and for ﬁner control see the str.format() method’s format speciﬁers in\\nformatstrings.\\nFor use cases which require exact decimal representation, try using the decimal module which implements\\ndecimal arithmetic suitable for accounting applications and high-precision applications.\\nAnother form of exact arithmetic is supported by the fractions module which implements arithmetic based\\non rational numbers (so the numbers like 1/3 can be represented exactly).\\nIf you are a heavy user of ﬂoating point operations you should take a look at the Numerical Python package\\nand many other packages for mathematical and statistical operations supplied by the SciPy project. See\\n<https://scipy.org>.\\nPython provides tools that may help on those rare occasions when you really do want to know the exact\\nvalue of a ﬂoat. The float.as_integer_ratio() method expresses the value of a ﬂoat as a fraction:\\n>>> x = 3.14159\\n>>> x.as_integer_ratio()\\n(3537115888337719, 1125899906842624)\\nSince the ratio is exact, it can be used to losslessly recreate the original value:\\n>>> x == 3537115888337719 / 1125899906842624\\nTrue\\nThe float.hex() method expresses a ﬂoat in hexadecimal (base 16), again giving the exact value stored by\\nyour computer:\\n>>> x.hex()\\n'0x1.921f9f01b866ep+1'\\nThis precise hexadecimal representation can be used to reconstruct the ﬂoat value exactly:\\n>>> x == float.fromhex('0x1.921f9f01b866ep+1')\\nTrue\\nSince the representation is exact, it is useful for reliably porting values across diﬀerent versions of Python\\n(platform independence) and exchanging data with other languages that support the same format (such as\\nJava and C99).\\nAnother helpful tool is the math.fsum() function which helps mitigate loss-of-precision during summation.\\nIt tracks “lost digits” as values are added onto a running total. That can make a diﬀerence in overall accuracy\\nso that the errors do not accumulate to the point where they aﬀect the ﬁnal total:\\n>>> sum([0.1] * 10) == 1.0\\nFalse\\n>>> math.fsum([0.1] * 10) == 1.0\\nTrue\\n107\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 113}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n15.1 Representation Error\\nThis section explains the “0.1” example in detail, and shows how you can perform an exact analysis of cases\\nlike this yourself. Basic familiarity with binary ﬂoating-point representation is assumed.\\nRepresentation error refers to the fact that some (most, actually) decimal fractions cannot be represented\\nexactly as binary (base 2) fractions. This is the chief reason why Python (or Perl, C, C++, Java, Fortran,\\nand many others) often won’t display the exact decimal number you expect.\\nWhy is that? 1/10 is not exactly representable as a binary fraction. Almost all machines today (November\\n2000) use IEEE-754 ﬂoating point arithmetic, and almost all platforms map Python ﬂoats to IEEE-754\\n“double precision”. 754 doubles contain 53 bits of precision, so on input the computer strives to convert 0.1\\nto the closest fraction it can of the form J/2**N where J is an integer containing exactly 53 bits. Rewriting\\n1 / 10 ~= J / (2**N)\\nas\\nJ ~= 2**N / 10\\nand recalling that J has exactly 53 bits (is >= 2**52 but < 2**53), the best value for N is 56:\\n>>> 2**52 <=\\n2**56 // 10\\n< 2**53\\nTrue\\nThat is, 56 is the only value for N that leaves J with exactly 53 bits. The best possible value for J is then\\nthat quotient rounded:\\n>>> q, r = divmod(2**56, 10)\\n>>> r\\n6\\nSince the remainder is more than half of 10, the best approximation is obtained by rounding up:\\n>>> q+1\\n7205759403792794\\nTherefore the best possible approximation to 1/10 in 754 double precision is:\\n7205759403792794 / 2 ** 56\\nDividing both the numerator and denominator by two reduces the fraction to:\\n3602879701896397 / 2 ** 55\\nNote that since we rounded up, this is actually a little bit larger than 1/10; if we had not rounded up, the\\nquotient would have been a little bit smaller than 1/10. But in no case can it be exactly 1/10!\\nSo the computer never “sees” 1/10: what it sees is the exact fraction given above, the best 754 double\\napproximation it can get:\\n>>> 0.1 * 2 ** 55\\n3602879701896397.0\\nIf we multiply that fraction by 10**55, we can see the value out to 55 decimal digits:\\n>>> 3602879701896397 * 10 ** 55 // 2 ** 55\\n1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625\\n108\\nChapter 15.\\nFloating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 114}, page_content=\"Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\nmeaning\\nthat\\nthe\\nexact\\nnumber\\nstored\\nin\\nthe\\ncomputer\\nis\\nequal\\nto\\nthe\\ndecimal\\nvalue\\n0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625.\\nInstead of displaying the full decimal\\nvalue, many languages (including older versions of Python), round the result to 17 signiﬁcant digits:\\n>>> format(0.1, '.17f')\\n'0.10000000000000001'\\nThe fractions and decimal modules make these calculations easy:\\n>>> from decimal import Decimal\\n>>> from fractions import Fraction\\n>>> Fraction.from_float(0.1)\\nFraction(3602879701896397, 36028797018963968)\\n>>> (0.1).as_integer_ratio()\\n(3602879701896397, 36028797018963968)\\n>>> Decimal.from_float(0.1)\\nDecimal('0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625')\\n>>> format(Decimal.from_float(0.1), '.17')\\n'0.10000000000000001'\\n15.1.\\nRepresentation Error\\n109\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 115}, page_content='Python Tutorial, Release 3.7.0\\n110\\nChapter 15.\\nFloating Point Arithmetic: Issues and Limitations'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'xdvipdfmx (0.7.9)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2018-09-02T00:46:10+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Tutorial_EDIT.pdf', 'total_pages': 155, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Python Tutorial', 'author': 'Guido van Rossum, and the Python development team', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2018-09-02T11:19:20-07:00', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': \"D:20180902111920-07'00'\", 'creationDate': 'D:20180902004610Z', 'page': 116}, page_content=\"CHAPTER\\nSIXTEEN\\nAPPENDIX\\n16.1 Interactive Mode\\n16.1.1 Error Handling\\nWhen an error occurs, the interpreter prints an error message and a stack trace. In interactive mode, it\\nthen returns to the primary prompt; when input came from a ﬁle, it exits with a nonzero exit status after\\nprinting the stack trace. (Exceptions handled by an except clause in a try statement are not errors in this\\ncontext.) Some errors are unconditionally fatal and cause an exit with a nonzero exit; this applies to internal\\ninconsistencies and some cases of running out of memory. All error messages are written to the standard\\nerror stream; normal output from executed commands is written to standard output.\\nTyping the interrupt character (usually Control-C or Delete) to the primary or secondary prompt cancels\\nthe input and returns to the primary prompt.1 Typing an interrupt while a command is executing raises\\nthe KeyboardInterrupt exception, which may be handled by a try statement.\\n16.1.2 Executable Python Scripts\\nOn BSD’ish Unix systems, Python scripts can be made directly executable, like shell scripts, by putting the\\nline\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3.5\\n(assuming that the interpreter is on the user’s PATH) at the beginning of the script and giving the ﬁle an\\nexecutable mode. The #! must be the ﬁrst two characters of the ﬁle. On some platforms, this ﬁrst line\\nmust end with a Unix-style line ending ('\\\\n'), not a Windows ('\\\\r\\\\n') line ending. Note that the hash, or\\npound, character, '#', is used to start a comment in Python.\\nThe script can be given an executable mode, or permission, using the chmod command.\\n$ chmod +x myscript.py\\nOn Windows systems, there is no notion of an “executable mode”.\\nThe Python installer automatically\\nassociates .py ﬁles with python.exe so that a double-click on a Python ﬁle will run it as a script. The\\nextension can also be .pyw, in that case, the console window that normally appears is suppressed.\\n16.1.3 The Interactive Startup File\\nWhen you use Python interactively, it is frequently handy to have some standard commands executed every\\ntime the interpreter is started.

Start Python and run this\\ncode:\\n>>> import site\\n>>> site.getusersitepackages()\\n'/home/user/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages'\\nNow you can create a ﬁle named usercustomize.py in that directory and put anything you want in it. It\\nwill aﬀect every invocation of Python, unless it is started with the -s option to disable the automatic import.\\nsitecustomize works in the same way, but is typically created by an administrator of the computer in the\\nglobal site-packages directory, and is imported before usercustomize.

The bytecode is also cached in .pyc ﬁles so that executing the same ﬁle\\nis faster the second time (recompilation from source to bytecode can be avoided). This “intermediate\\nlanguage” is said to run on a virtual machine that executes the machine code corresponding to each\\nbytecode. Do note that bytecodes are not expected to work between diﬀerent Python virtual machines,\\nnor to be stable between Python releases.\\nA list of bytecode instructions can be found in the documentation for the dis module.\\nclass A template for creating user-deﬁned objects.

For example, int(3.15) converts the ﬂoating point number to the\\ninteger 3, but in 3+4.5, each argument is of a diﬀerent type (one int, one ﬂoat), and both must be\\nconverted to the same type before they can be added or it will raise a TypeError. Without coercion, all\\narguments of even compatible types would have to be normalized to the same value by the programmer,\\ne.g., float(3)+4.5 rather than just 3+4.5.\\ncomplex number An extension of the familiar real number system in which all numbers are expressed as\\na sum of a real part and an imaginary part. Imaginary numbers are real multiples of the imaginary\\nunit (the square root of -1), often written i in mathematics or j in engineering. Python has built-in\\nsupport for complex numbers, which are written with this latter notation; the imaginary part is written\\nwith a j suﬃx, e.g., 3+1j. To get access to complex equivalents of the math module, use cmath. Use\\nof complex numbers is a fairly advanced mathematical feature.

See PEP 343.\\ncontiguous A buﬀer is considered contiguous exactly if it is either C-contiguous or Fortran contiguous.\\nZero-dimensional buﬀers are C and Fortran contiguous. In one-dimensional arrays, the items must\\nbe laid out in memory next to each other, in order of increasing indexes starting from zero.\\nIn\\nmultidimensional C-contiguous arrays, the last index varies the fastest when visiting items in order of\\nmemory address. However, in Fortran contiguous arrays, the ﬁrst index varies the fastest.\\ncoroutine Coroutines is a more generalized form of subroutines.

They provide a dynamic view on the dictionary’s entries, which means that when\\nthe dictionary changes, the view reﬂects these changes. To force the dictionary view to become a full\\nlist use list(dictview). See dict-views.\\ndocstring A string literal which appears as the ﬁrst expression in a class, function or module. While ignored\\nwhen the suite is executed, it is recognized by the compiler and put into the __doc__ attribute of the\\nenclosing class, function or module. Since it is available via introspection, it is the canonical place for\\ndocumentation of the object.\\nduck-typing A programming style which does not look at an object’s type to determine if it has the right\\ninterface; instead, the method or attribute is simply called or used (“If it looks like a duck and quacks\\nlike a duck, it must be a duck.”) By emphasizing interfaces rather than speciﬁc types, well-designed\\ncode improves its ﬂexibility by allowing polymorphic substitution.\\nDuck-typing avoids tests using\\ntype() or isinstance(). (Note, however, that duck-typing can be complemented with abstract base\\nclasses.) Instead, it typically employs hasattr() tests or EAFP programming.\\nEAFP Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.\\nThis common Python coding style assumes the\\nexistence of valid keys or attributes and catches exceptions if the assumption proves false. This clean\\nand fast style is characterized by the presence of many try and except statements. The technique\\ncontrasts with the LBYL style common to many other languages such as C.\\nexpression A piece of syntax which can be evaluated to some value.\\nIn other words, an expression is\\nan accumulation of expression elements like literals, names, attribute access, operators or function\\ncalls which all return a value.

Objects which are instances of user-deﬁned classes are hashable by default. They all\\ncompare unequal (except with themselves), and their hash value is derived from their id().\\nIDLE An Integrated Development Environment for Python.

Code executed during the shutdown phase can encounter various\\nexceptions as the resources it relies on may not function anymore (common examples are library\\nmodules or the warnings machinery).\\nThe main reason for interpreter shutdown is that the __main__ module or the script being run has\\nﬁnished executing.\\niterable An object capable of returning its members one at a time.\\nExamples of iterables include all\\nsequence types (such as list, str, and tuple) and some non-sequence types like dict, ﬁle objects,\\nand objects of any classes you deﬁne with an __iter__() method or with a __getitem__() method\\nthat implements Sequence semantics.\\nIterables can be used in a for loop and in many other places where a sequence is needed (zip(), map(),\\n…). When an iterable object is passed as an argument to the built-in function iter(), it returns an\\niterator for the object. This iterator is good for one pass over the set of values. When using iterables,\\nit is usually not necessary to call iter() or deal with iterator objects yourself. The for statement\\ndoes that automatically for you, creating a temporary unnamed variable to hold the iterator for the\\nduration of the loop. See also iterator, sequence, and generator.\\niterator An object representing a stream of data. Repeated calls to the iterator’s __next__() method\\n(or passing it to the built-in function next()) return successive items in the stream. When no more\\ndata are available a StopIteration exception is raised instead. At this point, the iterator object is\\nexhausted and any further calls to its __next__() method just raise StopIteration again. Iterators\\nare required to have an __iter__() method that returns the iterator object itself so every iterator is\\nalso iterable and may be used in most places where other iterables are accepted. One notable exception\\nis code which attempts multiple iteration passes. A container object (such as a list) produces a fresh\\nnew iterator each time you pass it to the iter() function or use it in a for loop. Attempting this\\nwith an iterator will just return the same exhausted iterator object used in the previous iteration pass,\\nmaking it appear like an empty container.\\nMore information can be found in typeiter.\\nkey function A key function or collation function is a callable that returns a value used for sorting or\\nordering. For example, locale.strxfrm() is used to produce a sort key that is aware of locale speciﬁc\\nsort conventions.\\nA number of tools in Python accept key functions to control how elements are ordered or grouped.\\nThey include min(), max(), sorted(), list.sort(), heapq.merge(), heapq.nsmallest(), heapq.\\nnlargest(), and itertools.groupby().\\nThere are several ways to create a key function. For example. the str.lower() method can serve\\nas a key function for case insensitive sorts. Alternatively, a key function can be built from a lambda\\nexpression such as lambda r: (r[0], r[2]). Also, the operator module provides three key function\\nconstructors: attrgetter(), itemgetter(), and methodcaller().\\nSee the Sorting HOW TO for\\nexamples of how to create and use key functions.\\nkeyword argument See argument.\\nlambda An anonymous inline function consisting of a single expression which is evaluated when the function\\nis called.

Guido remains Python’s\\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI,\\nsee https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.\\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen\\nPythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now\\nZope Corporation; see http://www.zope.com/). In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https:\\n//www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-proﬁt organization created speciﬁcally to own Python-related\\nIntellectual Property. Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.\\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org/ for the Open Source Deﬁnition).
